OVERVIEW....

    A key element of the Centrallix application server is simplicity and ease
    of application authoring.  To help meet this requirement, the "autoform"
    widget is being introduced.

    An autoform is similar in some ways to the form widget, but it is designed
    to automatically fill in all needed form element widgets in a meaningful
    manner.  This is done basically by querying the type of object to be
    displayed in the form, determining what fields/attributes are present,
    and then using a set of heuristics, automatically do the layout for the
    widget.

    In this way an autoform is a "composite widget", having a simple 
    definition in the .app file but resulting in a potentially complex set
    of widgets in the actual widget tree to be deployed to the client.  At
    the time of writing, the only other composite widget is the formbar,
    which is more of a demonstration of what is possible with composite
    widgets than anything else.


HEURISTICS...

    The autoform will use semi-intelligent heuristics to do the form element
    layout.  These heuristics are briefly itemized below.

    A.	Use Presentation Hints and Data Types for Widget Selection.

	The autoform should query presentation hints for each field in order
	to determine what type of form element to use, in addition to 
	considering the data type.

    B.	Create both Labels and Form Elements.

	The autoform will create labels, where desirable, for each form
	element generated.

    C.	Use Field Length to Size Editboxes and Textareas.

	Field lengths, from presentation hints, an be an important cue in
	the sizing of editboxes on screen.  However, this can't be followed
	exactly; a String(255) field would not necessitate an editbox that
	could display 255 characters all at once!

    D.	Keep Different Widget Sizes to a Minimum.

	When laying out the form, choose a minimum set of different widget
	widths (e.g., editbox widths).  This keeps the visual layout looking
	cleaner.

    E.	Use a Columnar Layout.

	Form Elements should be displayed in columns, with a list of labels
	on the left and a list of form elements on the right.  Labels should
	be right-justified, and elements aligned on the left side.

	The .app creator may choose to specify the number of widget columns
	to use, or the autoform may determine that dynamically given the
	available width and height.

    F.	Use a Tab Control or "Advanced" Window if Needed.

	Should the needed fields not fit in the required area, such devices
	as a tab control or a window can be used.  When dividing form elements
	between the display areas, attention should be given to the 
	presentation hints data.  The "Show Container" API on the client will
	result in the window or tab automatically changing/opening should the
	user tab between fields not in the same display area.

	A scrollpane widget can also be used when form elements will not fit
	in the given area.  Attention should be given to make sure that the
	scrollpane automatically scrolls to show the element of focus.

    G.	Choosing to Display Navigation Buttons.

	Forms usually need navigation buttons, such as the formbar and/or
	Search/New/Edit/Save/Cancel/Delete buttons.  The .app file author
	should be able to specify which of these is needed.  If the form
	is marked non-editable, for example, the Edit and Save buttons
	may be omitted.  A search-only form would only require a Search
	button and a Cancel button.

    H.	Group Similar Widgets Together.

	When there are several checkboxes, those should be placed together
	to neaten up the visual appearance.  It may or may not be advisable
	to do this with other widget types.

    I.	Follow Native Field Order.

	When possible and reasonable, the autoform should lay out the form
	elements in a similar order to how they natively were listed in the
	object that came from the server.

    J.	Group Related Fields Near Each Other.

	Some fields may have presentation hint data, such as constraints or
	defaults, which link them to other fields.  Such fields can, if
	possible, be displayed near each other rather than farther away.

	Fields also might be grouped in the Presentation hints via the
	'group name' hint.  Such fields should nearly always be grouped
	together.

    K.	Save Space by Grouping Short Editboxes.

	If there are several editboxes which are shorter than usual, some
	space can be saved by putting more than one editbox in an area
	where ordinarily only one editbox might fit.  Examples of this 
	include City/State/Zip editboxes.

    L.	Use "Pick" Buttons.

	For fields that indicate a code list enumeration or SQL query, a
	pick button can be generated.
