Document:   JSON data format for OSML-over-HTTP for OSRC widget

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new data format to be used for OSML-over-HTTP shall be identical to the
"full" format used for JSON-REST:

	Full Format

	The Full Format will be used to transfer metadata about each
	attribute in addition to the attribute's name and value:

	    { "a":"age", "e":null, "v":32, "t":"integer", "h":"d=0" }

	In the above representation, the property names are abbreviated for
	space savings, and mean the following:

	    a = name of attribute
	    e = error status, null (or not present) if no error.  If set, it
		will either be the string "error" or a string containing an
		error message.
	    v = attribute's value (same representation as in the Basic Format)
	    t = data type (integer, double, string, money, datetime)
	    h = presentation hints, as encoded by hntEncodeHints() and as
		decoded by cx_parse_hints in JavaScript.  If no hints are
		available, the h property may be omitted entirely.

	The 'a' property above will be omitted if the name has already been
	specified outside of the full format attribute, for instance if
	a list of attributes is contained in a JSON Object.

	Full:

	    {
		"@id":"/people/001?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=full",
		"first_name": { "v":"John", "t":"string", "h":"l=64" }
		"last_name": { "v":"Smith", "t":"string", "h":"l=64" }
	    }

Since the ordering of the objects can be important (as with a SQL order by
clause), the list of such objects will be numbered, rather than associative:

	{
	    "status": null,
	    "session": "X ...",
	    "query": "X ...",
	    "resultset":
		[
		{ "@id": ... },
		{ "@id": ... },
		]
	}
