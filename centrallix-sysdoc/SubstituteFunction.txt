OVERVIEW...

    The substitute() function, available in Centrallix SQL both on the server
    and on the client, allows for the dynamic formatting of data elements into
    a string.

    This functionality is used for custom formatting of names, addresses, and
    potentially other related information.

    This document specifies the format used by substitute().


SYNTAX...

    strval = substitute(format [, objectmap])

    'strval' is the resulting formatted string.
    'format' is the formatting string, as specified by this document.
    'objectmap' is a string specifying available object names to be used.


FORMAT...

    The format string can contain arbitrary text as well as a series of
    placeholders that specify data to be inserted or conditional formatting.

    A.	Simple Attribute Reference [:attrname]

    B.	Object and Attribute Reference [:objname:attrname]

    C.	Conditional Formatting if Attribute is Set

	[+:attrname]Conditional Text goes Here[/+:attrname]
	[+:objname:attrname]Conditional Text goes Here[/+:objname:attrname]

	These conditionals trigger IF ALL of the following are TRUE:

	    1.	Attribute is NOT NULL
	    2.	Attribute is not a string, or if a string, is non-empty.
	    3.	Attribute is not an integer, or if an integer, is non-zero.

	A string is considered "empty" if it has a zero length when trimmed
	of leading and trailing spaces.


    D.	Conditional Formatting if Any Attribute is Set

	[+:firstattr,:secondattr]Text[/+:firstattr,:secondattr]

	These conditionals are like simple conditional formatting when an
	attribute is set, but this allows formatting the text if ANY of
	the comma-separate attributes (or :objname:attrname) are set.

	To do conditional formatting when ALL of a set of attributes are
	set, just nest the single-attribute version of this format.


    E.	Conditional Formatting if Attribute is Unset

	[-:attrname]Conditional Text goes Here[/-:attrname]
	[-:objname:attrname]Conditional Text goes Here[/-:objname:attrname]

	These conditionals trigger IF ANY of the following are TRUE:

	    1.	Attribute is NULL
	    2.	Attribute is a string and is empty
	    3.	Attribute is an integer and is zero

	A string is considered "empty" if it has a zero length when trimmed
	of leading and trailing spaces.


    F.	Conditional Formatting if Attribute has a Certain Value

	[?:attrname=Value]Conditional Text[/?:attrname=Value]
	[?:objname:attrname=Value]Conditional Text[/?:objname:attrname=Value]

	These conditionals trigger if the attribute is not null and has the
	given value.


    G.	Shortened ending tag.

	The full ending tag may be used for clarity, but the ending tag may
	also be shortened to just:

	    [/]

	Or, shortened to any of the below, based on the type of tag being used:

	    [/+]
	    [/-]
	    [/?]
