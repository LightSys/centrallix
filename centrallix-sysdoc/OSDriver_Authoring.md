I   INTRODUCTION

    An objectsystem driver's purpose is to provide access to a particular type
    of local or network data/resource, and to organize that data in a tree-
    structured heirarchy that can be integrated into the Centrallix's 
    ObjectSystem.  This tree structure will vary based on the data being 
    presented, but will fit the basic ObjectSystem model of a heirarchy of
    objects, each having attributes, perhaps some methods, and possibly 
    content.  

    Each objectsystem driver will implement this subtree structure rooted
    at what is called the "node" object.  The node has a specifically 
    recognizable object type which the ObjectSystem Management Layer uses to
    determine which OS Driver to pass control to.  Normally, the 'node'
    object is a UNIX file either with a particular extension registered 
    with the OSML, or a UNIX file residing in a directory containing a '.type'
    file, which contains the explicit object type for all objects in that 
    directory without recognizable extensions.

    Normally, objectsystem drivers will be able to manage any number of 'node'
    objects and the subtrees rooted at them.  Each 'node' object will normally
    relate to a particular instance of a network resource, or in some cases, a
    group of resources that are easily enumerated.  For example, a POP3 server
    would be a network resource that an OS driver could be written for.  If 
    the network had multiple POP3 servers, then that one OS driver would be
    able to access each of them using different node objects.  However, if 
    somehow the OS driver were able to easily enumerate the various POP3
    servers on the network (i.e., they responded to some kind of hypothetical
    broadcast query), then the OS driver author could optionally design the
    driver to list the POP3 servers under a single node for the whole network.

    The structure of the subtree beneath the node object is entirely up to the
    drivers' author to determine; the OSML does not impose any structural
    restrictions on such subtrees.

    Here is one example of an OS Driver's node object and subtree (this is
    for the Sybase OS Driver, objdrv_sybase.c):

    OMSS_DB (type = application/sybase)
        |
	+--- JNetHelp (type = system/table)
	|       |
	|	+--- columns (type = system/table-columns)
	|	|       |
	|	|	+--- document_id (type = system/column)
	|	|	|
	|	|	+--- parent_id (type = system/column)
	|	|	|
	|	|	+--- title (type = system/column)
	|	|	|
	|	|	+--- content (type = system/column)
	|	|
	|	+--- rows (type = system/table-rows)
	|	        |
	|	        +--- 1 (type = system/row)
	|	        |
	|	        +--- 2 (type = system/row)
	|
	+--- Partner (type = system/table)

	(... and so forth)

    In this case the node object would contain the information necessary to
    access the database, such as server name, database name, max connections
    to pool, and so forth.  More about the node object and managing its 
    parameters will be discussed later in this document.

    OS Drivers support several primary areas of functionality:  opening and
    closing objects, reading and writing object content (if the object has
    content), setting and viewing object attributes, executing object methods,
    and querying an object's child objects based on name and/or attribute
    values.  Drivers will also support the creation and deletion of objects
    and/or a set of child objects.


II  INTERFACE

    This section describes the standard interface between the OSML and the
    ObjectSystem driver itself.

    A.  Initialization.

        Each OS Driver will have an initialization function, normally named
	xxxInitialize() where 'xxx' is the driver's abbreviative prefix.  This
	prefix should be attached to each and every function within the 
	OS driver for consistency and project management.  Normally 'xxx' is
	two to four characters, all lowercase.  This initialization function
	is called when the Centrallix starts up, and at least at the present
	time, this initial call to the OS driver must be manually added to 
	the appropriate startup code, currently found in 'centrallix.c'.

	Within the initialization function, the driver should initialize all
	necessary global variables and register itself with the OSML.  Global
	variables should all be placed inside a single global 'struct', which
	is normally named similarly to the driver's prefix, except normally
	in all uppercase.  Under no circumstances should global variables be
	accessed outside of the module, except via the module's functions.

	To register with the OSML, the driver must first allocate an ObjDriver
	structure and fill in its contents.  

	    pObjDriver drv;

	    drv = (pObjDriver)nmMalloc(sizeof(ObjDriver));
	
	This involves setting a large number of fields to the appropriate
	entry points within the OS Driver, as well as telling the OSML what
	object type(s) are handled by the driver and giving the OSML a
	description of the driver.  A list of the required entry point
	functions / fields follows:

	    Open		Function that the OSML calls when the user
	    			opens an object managed by this driver.
	    Close		Close an open object.
	    Create		Create a new object.
	    Delete		Delete an existing object.

	    OpenQuery		Start a query for child objects.
	    QueryDelete		Delete all objects in the query result set.
	    QueryFetch		Open the next child object in the query's
	    			result set.
	    QueryClose		Close an open query.

	    Read		Read content from the object.
	    Write		Write content to the object.

	    GetAttrType		Get the type of an object's attribute.
	    GetAttrValue	Get the value of an object's attribute.
	    GetFirstAttr	Get the first attribute associated with the
	    			object.
	    GetNextAttr		Get the next attribute associated with the
	    			object.
	    SetAttrValue	Set the value of an attribute.
	    AddAttr		Add a new attribute to an object.
	    OpenAttr		Open an attribute as if it were an object
	    			with content.

	    GetFirstMethod	Get the first method of the object.
	    GetNextMethod	Get the next method of an object.
	    ExecuteMethod	Execute a method with an optional string
	    			parameter.

	The only method that can be set to NULL is the QueryDelete method,
	in which case the OSML will call QueryFetch() and Delete() in 
	succession.  However, if the underlying network resource has the 
	capability of intelligently deleting objects matching the query's
	criteria, this method should be implemented (as with a database
	server).

	Another field in the driver structure is the Capabilities field.
	This field is a bitmask, and can currently contain zero or more
	of the following options:

	    OBJDRV_C_FULLQUERY	Indicates that this objectsystem driver will
	    			intelligently process the query's expression
				tree specified in the OpenQuery call, and 
				will only return objects that match that 
				expression.  If this flag is missing, the
				OSML will filter objects returned by 
				QueryFetch so that the calling user does
				not get objects that do not match the query.
				Typically this is set by database server
				drivers.

				THE ABOVE IS OUT-OF-DATE.  From now on, a
				driver can determine whether to handle the
				Where and OrderBy on a per-query basis, by
				setting values in the ObjQuery structure used
				when opening a new query.  This is because a
				driver may be able to handle Where and OrderBy
				for some object listings but not for others.

	    OBJDRV_C_TRANS	Indicates that this objectsystem driver 
	    			requires transaction management by the OSML's
				transaction layer (the OXT layer).  OS drivers
				that require this normally are those that for
				some reason cannot complete operations in
				independence from one another.  For example, 
				with a database driver, the creation of a new
				row object and the setting of its attributes
				must be done as one operation, although the 
				operation requires several calls from the end
				user's process.  The OXT allows for the 
				grouping of objectsystem calls so that the 
				os driver does not have to complete them
				independently, but instead can wait until 
				several calls have been made before actually
				completing the operation.

	The 'Name' field should be filled in with a description of the OS
	driver, with a maximum length of 63 characters (plus the string null
	terminator).  Normally, the 2-4 letter prefix of the driver is 
	included at the beginning of 'Name', such as "UXD - UNIX filesystem
	driver".  

	Finally, the 'RootContentTypes' field is an XArray containing a list
	of strings, each of which specifies the node object types that the 
	driver will handle.  Such types are added to this XArray using the 
	normal XArray utility functions, such as:

	    xaInit(&drv->RootContentTypes, 16);
	    xaAddItem(&drv->RootContentTypes, "system/file");
	    xaAddItem(&drv->RootContentTypes, "system/directory");

	When the structure has been filled out, the os driver should call
	the OSML to register itself, using the objRegisterDriver function:

	    objRegisterDriver(drv);

	The initialization function should return 0 to indicate success, or
	-1 on failure.  Currently, initialization success/failure is not
	verified by lsmain.c.

	The driver should NOT nmFree() the allocated driver structure unless
	the objRegisterDriver() routine fails (returns -1).

	Note that the RootContentTypes handled by the driver should only
	include the types of the objects this driver will handle as node 
	objects.  For instance, the Sybase database access driver uses
	"application/sybase" as its top level type.  It won't register such
	things as "system/table".


    B.  Opening And Closing Objects.

        As an overview, the normal procedure for the open routine to follow
	is this:

	    1.  Access the node object, or create it, depending on whether the
	        object already exists as well as the open mode flags indicated
		by the end-user.
	    2.  Upon successful node object access, determine what additional
	        components of the pathname are to be handled by this driver,
		and verify that they can be opened, depending on the object's
		open mode (CREAT, EXCL, etc.)
	    3.  If it hasn't been already, allocate a structure that will 
	        represent this open object and contain information about it and
		how we're to handle it.  It should include a pointer to the
		node object.
	    4.  Perform any operations inherent in the open process that have
	        not already been performed (such as reading database table 
		information, etc., when a db table's row is being accessed).
	    5.  Return a pointer to the structure allocated in (3) as a void
	        pointer.  The OSML will pass this pointer back to the driver on
		subsequent calls that involve this object.

        The first basic part of the OS driver consists of the Open and
	Close routines, normally named 'xxxOpen' and 'xxxClose' within the
	driver, where 'xxx' is the driver's prefix.  The Close routine is
	normally fairly simple, but the Open routine is one of the most 
	complicated routines in a typical OS driver, for the Open routine
	must parse the subtree pathname beneath the node object.  For
	example, if the node object had a pathname like:

	    /datasources/OMSS_DB

	and the user opened an object called:

	    /datasources/OMSS_DB/JNetHelp/rows/1

	the OS driver would have to determine what the subtree pathname
	'JNetHelp/rows/1' means, since this path will mean different things
	to different os drivers.

	The Open routine also must determine whether the object already 
	exists or not, and if not, whether to create a new object.  This logic
	is largely dependent on the obj->Mode flags, as if O_CREAT is 
	included, the driver must attempt to create the object if it does not
	already exist, and if O_EXCL is included, the driver must refuse to
	open the object if it already exists, as with the UNIX open() system
	call semantics.  

	Finally, if the os driver specified a capability of OBJDRV_C_TRANS,
	it must pay attention to the current state of the end-user's trans-
	action.  If a new object is being created, an object is being deleted,
	or other modifications/additions are being performed, and if the OXT
	layer indicates a transaction is in process, the driver must either
	complete the current transaction and then complete the current call,
	or else add the current delete/create/modify call to the transaction
	tree (in which case the tree item is preallocated; all the driver 
	needs to do is fill it in).  The transaction layer will be discussed
	in depth later in this document.

	As a part of the Open process, the OS driver will normally allocate
	an internal structure to represent the current open object, and will
	return that structure as a void* data type in the return value.  This
	pointer will be then passed to each of the other driver entry point
	functions, with the exception of QueryFetch, QueryDelete, and Query-
	Close, which will be discussed later.

	The Open() routine is called with five parameters:

	    obj (pObject)	This is a pointer to the Object sturcture
	    			maintained by the OSML.  This structure will
				contain some important fields for processing
				the open() request.

				obj->Mode is a bitmask of the O_* flags, which
				include O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT,
				O_TRUNC, and O_EXCL.

				obj->Pathname is a Pathname structure which
				contains the complete parsed pathname for the
				object.  This structure is defined in the
				file include/obj.h, and has a buffer for the
				pathname as well as an array of pointers to
				the pathname's components.  The function
				obj_internal_PathPart() can be used to obtain
				at will any component or series of components
				of the pathname.

				obj->Pathname->OpenCtl[] contains parameters to
				the open() operation.  Frequently these params
				provide additional information on how to open
				the object.  The use of these parameters is 
				determined by the author of the objectsystem
				driver.  The parameters are those passed in
				normal URL fasion (?param=value, etc.).
				Typically, the only OpenCtl of interest is 
				going to be obj->Pathname->OpenCtl[obj->SubPtr]
				(see below for SubPtr meaning).

				obj->SubPtr is the number of components in
				the path that are a part of the node object's
				path.  For example, in the above path of
				'/datasources/OMSS_DB', the path would be 
				internally represented as './datasources/
				OMSS_DB', and the SubPtr would be 3.

				obj->SubCnt reflects the number of components
				of the path which are under the control of the
				current driver.  This includes the node object,
				so SubCnt will always be at least 1.  For 
				example, when opening '/data/file.csv/rows/1',
				and the driver in question is the CSV driver,
				SubPtr would be 3 (includes an "invisible"
				first component), from '/data/file.csv', and
				SubCnt would be 3, from 'file.csv/rows/1'.
				The driver will need to SET THE SUBCNT value in
				its Open function.  SubPtr is already set.

				obj->Prev is the underlying object as opened by
				the next-lower-level driver.  It is the duty of
				this driver to parse the content of that object
				and do something meaningful with it.

				obj->Prev->Flags contains some critical infor-
				mation about the underlying object.  If it 
				contains the flag OBJ_F_CREATED, then the 
				underlying object was just created by this 
				open() operation.  In that case, this driver is
				expected to create the node with snNewNode()
				(see later in this document) as long as
				obj->Mode contains O_CREAT.

	    mask (int)		Indicates the security mask to be given to the
	    			object if it is being created.  Typically, this
				will only apply to files and directories.  The
				values are the same as UNIX chmod() type 
				values.

	    systype (pContentType) This param indicates the content type of the
	    			node object as determined by the OSML.  The 
				ContentType structure is defined in include/
				obj.h, and includes among other things the name
				of the content type.  For example, for the
				reporting driver, this type would be 
				"system/report".

	    usrtype (char*)	This param is the requested object type by the
	    			user and is normally used when creating a new
				object, though under some circumstances it may
				change the way the open operates on an existing
				object.  For example, the reporting driver can
				change whether it generates HTML report text or
				plaintext reports based on usrtype being either
				"text/html" or "text/plain".

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	This param is only used by object drivers that
	    			specified a capability of OBJDRV_C_TRANS.  More
				on this field later.  For non-transaction-aware
				drivers, this field can be safely ignored.

				Yes, this param *is* a pointer to a pointer.
				Essentially, a pointer passed by reference.

	The Open routine should return its internal structure pointer on 
	success, or NULL on failure.  It is normal to allocate one such
	structure per Open call, and for the structure to point, among other
	things, to shared data describing the node object.  Accessing the
	node object is described later in this document.

	It is important to know what kinds of fields normally are placed in the
	allocated data structure returned by Open.  These fields are all 
	determined by the driver author, but here are a few typical ones that
	are helpful to have ("inf" is the pointer to the structure here):

	    inf->Obj (pObject)	This is a copy of the 'obj' pointer passed to
	    			the Open routine.
	    inf->Mask (int)	The 'mask' argument passed to Open.
	    inf->Node (pSnNode)	A pointer to the node object, as returned from
	    			snNewNode() or snReadNode(), or if structure
				files aren't being used as the node content
				type, a pointer to whatever structure contains
				information about the node object.

	The Close() routine is called with two parameters:

	    inf_v (void*)	This param is the pointer that the Open routine
	    			returned.  Normally the driver will cast the 
				void* parameter to some other structure 
				pointer to access the object's information.

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	The transaction tree pointer.

	The Close routine should return 0 on success or -1 on failure.  The 
	os driver must make sure it properly deallocates the memory used by
	originally opening the object, such as the internal structure returned
	by open and passed in as inf_v.

	Note the semantics of a Close failure - the object should still be 
	closed in whatever way is still meaningful.  The end-user must deal 
	with the situation by reviewing the returned mssError messages.

	Before exiting, the Close routine should make sure it decrements the
	Open Count (node->OpenCnt--).  Before doing so, it should also perform
	a snWriteNode() to write any modified node information back to the node
	object.


    C.  Creating and Deleting Objects.

        The Create and Delete functions are used for creating and deleting
	objects.  Normally, the os driver will process the Pathname in the
	same manner for Create and Delete as for Open, thus such functionality
	could be placed in another function.  
	
	As a side note, within Centrallix, the standard function naming
	convention is to use xxx_internal_FunctionName for functions that are
	more or less internal to the module and not a part of any standard 
	interface.

	The Create routine has parameters identical to the Open routine.  It
	should return 0 on success and -1 on error.

	The Delete routine is passed the following parameters:

	    obj (pObject)	The Object structure pointer, used in the
	    			same way as in Open and Delete.

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	The transaction tree pointer.

	Delete should return 0 on success and -1 on failure.

	For many objectsystem drivers, the Create function simply calls the
	driver's internal Open() with O_CREAT and then its internal Close,
	although some drivers could manage Create differently from Open.


    D.  Reading and Writing Object Content.

        Some, but not all, objects will have content.  If the object does or
	can have content, the driver should handle these functions as is
	appropriate.  Otherwise, the driver should return a failure code (-1)
	from these functions.

	The Read routine reads content from the object, as if  reading from a
	file.  The parameters passed are almost identical to those used in the
	fdRead command in MTASK: 

	    inf_v (void*)	The generic pointer to the structure returned
	    			from Open().

	    buffer (char*)	The destination buffer for the data being
	    			read in.

	    maxcnt (int)	The maximum number of bytes to read into the
	    			buffer.

	    flags (int)		Either 0 or FD_U_SEEK, in which case the user
	    			is specifying the seek offset for the read in
				the 5th argument.  Of course, not all objects
				will be seekable, and furthermore, some of the
				objects handled by the driver may have full or
				limited seek functionality, even though others
				may not.

	    arg (int)		Extra argument, currently only used to specify
	    			an optional seek offset.

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	The transaction tree pointer.
	
	The Write routine is very similar, except that instead of 'maxcnt',
	the third argument is 'cnt', and specifies how much data is in the 
	buffer waiting to be written.

	Each of these routines should return -1 on failure and return the
	number of bytes read/written on success.  At end of file or on device
	hangup, 0 should be returned once, and then subsequent calls should
	return -1.


    E.  Querying for Child Objects.

        Many objects will have the capability of having sub-objects beneath
	them, called child objects.  In such a case, the parent object becomes
	a directory of sorts, even though the parent object may also have 
	content, something which is somewhat foreign in the standard filesystem
	world, but is common for web servers, where opening a directory returns
	the file 'index.html' on many occasions.

	To enumerate a parent object's child objects, the query functions are
	used.  A query may have a specific criteria so that only objects 
	having certain attributes will be listed.  As mentioned earlier in this
	document, a driver may or may not choose to intelligently handle those
	criteria.  The driver has the option of always enumerating all child
	objects via its query functions, and allowing the OSML filter them and
	only return to the user the objects that match the criteria.  But it
	also can do the filtering itself or, more typically, pass the filtering
	on to the source of the data the driver manages, as with a database
	server.

	The query mechanism can also be used to delete a set of child objects,
	optionally matching a certain criteria.  The QueryDelete method may be
	left NULL in the ObjDriver structure if the driver does not implement
	full query support, in which case the OSML will iterate through the
	query results and delete the objects one by one.

	The first main function for handling queries is OpenQuery.  This 
	function is passed three arguments:

	    inf_v (void*)	The value returned from Open for this object.

	    query (pObjQuery)	The query structure setup by the OSML.  It will
	    			contain several key fields:

				query->QyText: the text of the criteria (i.e.,
				the WHERE clause, in Centrallix SQL syntax)

				query->Tree: the compiled expression tree, 
				which evaluates to nonzero for true or zero for
				false as the WHERE clause condition.

				query->SortBy[]: an array of expressions giving
				the various components of the sorting criteria.

				query->Flags: the driver should set and/or 
				clear the flags OBJ_QY_F_FULLQUERY and
				OBJ_QY_F_FULLSORT if need be.  The former
				indicates that the driver is willing to handle
				the full WHERE clause (the query->Tree).  The
				latter indicates that the driver is willing to
				handle the sorting of the data as well (in
				query->SortBy[]).  If the driver can easily
				have the sorting/selection done (as when 
				querying an RDBMS), it should set these flags.
				Otherwise, it should let the OSML take care of
				the ORDER BY and WHERE conditions.

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	The transaction tree pointer.

	The OpenQuery function should return a void* value, which will within
	the driver point to a structure used for managing the query.  This 
	structure will normally have a pointer to the inf_v value returned
	by Open as well, since inf_v is never passed to QueryFetch, QueryDelete
	or QueryClose.  OpenQuery should return NULL if the object does not 
	support queries or if some other error condition occurs that will 
	prevent the execution of the query.

	Once the query is underway with OpenQuery, the user will either start
	fetching the results with QueryFetch, or will issue a delete operation
	with QueryDelete.

	The QueryFetch routine should return an inf_v pointer to the child
	object, or NULL if no more child objects are to be returned by the
	query.  Some drivers may be able to use their internal Open function
	to generate the newly opened object, although others will directly
	allocate the inf_v structure and fill it in based on the current
	queried child object.  QueryFetch will be passed these parameters:

	    qy_v (void*)	The value returned by OpenQuery.

	    obj (pObject)	The newly-created object structure that the
	    			OSML is using to track the newly queried 
				child object.

	    mode (int)		The open mode for the new object, as with
	    			obj->Mode in Open().

	    oxt (pObjTrxTree*)	The transaction tree pointer.

	All object drivers will need to add an element to the obj->Pathname
	structure to indicate the path to the child object being returned.
	This will involve a process somewhat like this: (given that new_name
	is the new object's name, qy is the current query structure, which
	contains a field 'Parent' that points to the inf_v originally returned
	by Open, and where the inf_v contains a field Obj that points to the
	Object structure containing a Pathname structure)

	    int cnt;
	    pObject obj;
	    char* new_name;
	    pMyDriversQueryInf qy;

	    /** Build the filename. **/
	    cnt = snprintf(obj->Pathname->Pathbuf, 256, "%s/%s",
	    	qy->Parent->Obj->Pathname->Pathbuf,new_name);
	    if (cnt < 0 || cnt >= 256) return NULL;
	    obj->Pathname->Elements[obj->Pathname->nElements++] = 
	    	strrchr(obj->Pathname->Pathbuf,'/')+1;

	QueryDelete is passed the qy_v void* parameter, and an oxt parameter.
	It should return 0 on successful deletion, and -1 on failure.

	QueryClose is also passed qy_v and oxt.  It should close the query,
	whether or not QueryFetch has been called enough times to enumerate
	all of the query results.


    F.  Managing Object Attributes

        All objects will have at least some attributes.  Five attributes are
	mandatory: 'name', 'content_type', 'inner_type', 'outer_type', and 
	'annotation'.  All compliant drivers must implement these five
	attributes, all of which have a data type of DATA_T_STRING.

	Currently, the OS specification includes support for the following
	data types:

	    DATA_T_INTEGER	-	32-bit signed integer.
	    DATA_T_STRING	-	Zero-terminated ASCII string.
	    DATA_T_DOUBLE	-	Double-precision floating point.
	    DATA_T_DATETIME	-	date/time structure.
	    DATA_T_MONEY	-	money data type.

	True/false or on/off attributes should be treated as DATA_T_INTEGER
	for the time being with values of 0 and 1.

	Here is a description of the functionality of the five mandatory
	attributes:

	    'name'		This attribute indicates the name of the
	    			object, just as it should appear in any
				directory listing.  The name of the object
				must be unique for the directory it is in.
	    'content_type'	This is the type of the object's content, given
	    			as a MIME-type.
	    'annotation'	This is an annotation for the object.  While
	    			users may not assign annotations to all 
				objects, each object should be able to have
				an annotation.  Normally the annotation is a
				short description of what the object is.  For
				the Sybase driver, annotations for rows are
				created by assigning an 'expression' to the
				table in question, such as 'first_name + 
				last_name' for a people table.
	    'inner_type'	An alias for 'content_type'.  Both should be
	    			supported.
	    'outer_type'	This is the type of the object itself (the 
	    			container).

	A sixth attribute is not mandatory, but is useful if the object might
	have content that could in turn be a node object (be interpreted by
	another driver).  This attribute is 'last_modification', of type
	DATA_T_DATETIME, and should indicate when the object's content was last
	updated or modified.
	
	The first function to be aware of is the GetAttrType function.  This
	routine takes the inf_v pointer, the name of the attribute in question,
	and the oxt* pointer.  It should return the DATA_T_xxx value for the
	data type of the attribute.

	Next is the GetAttrValue function, which takes four parameters: the
	inf_v pointer, the name of the attribute, a void pointer pointing to
	where the attribute's value will be put, and the oxt* pointer.  The
	way the value pointer is handled depends on the data type.  For 
	DATA_T_INTEGER types, the value pointer is assumed to be pointing to
	a 32-bit integer where the integer value can be written.  For DATA_T_
	STRING types, the value pointer is assumed to be pointing to an empty
	pointer location where a pointer to the string can be stored.  For
	DATA_T_DATETIME types, the value pointer is assumed to be pointing to
	an empty pointer where a pointer to a date time structure (from obj.h)
	can be stored.  And for double values, the value pointer points to 
	a double value where the double will be stored.  In this way, integer
	and double values are returned from GetAttrValue by value, and string
	or datetime values are returned from GetAttrValue by reference.  Items
	returned by reference must be guaranteed to be valid until the object
	is closed, or another GetAttrValue or SetAttrValue call is made.  This
	function should return -1 on a non-existent attribute, 0 on success, 
	and 1 if the value is NULL or unset.

	UPDATE ON GETATTR/SETATTR:  These functions now, instead of taking
	a void* pointer for the value, take a pObjData pointer, which
	points to an ObjData structure.  The POD(x) macro can be used to
	typecast appropriate pointers to a pObjData pointer.  The ObjData
	structure is a UNION type of structure, allowing easy manipulation
	of data of various types.  See 'datatypes.h'.  Note that this is binary
	compatible with the old way of using a typecasted void pointer.

	The SetAttrValue function works much the same way as GetAttrValue,
	just with the information moving in the opposite direction.  The third
	parameter, void* value, is treated in the same manner.

	The GetFirstAttr and GetNextAttr functions each take two parameters, 
	the inf_v pointer and the oxt* pointer, and are used to iterate through
	the non-mandatory attributes for the object.  GetFirstAttr should 
	return a string naming the first attribute, and GetNextAttr should 
	iterate through subsequent attributes.  When the attributes are 
	exhausted, these functions should return NULL.  The attributes 'name',
	'annotation', and 'content_type' should not be returned.  If the object
	has no other attributes, GetFirstAttr should return NULL.

	AddAttr is used to add a new attribute to an existing object.  Not all
	objects support this, and many will refuse the operation.  The
	parameters are as follows: void* inf_v, char* attrname, int type,
	void* value, and pObjTrxTree* oxt.

	OpenAttr is used to open an attribute for objRead/objWrite as if it 
	were an object with content.  Not all object drivers will support this;
	this routine should return an inf_v pointer for the new descriptor,
	and takes four parameters: void* inf_v, char* attrname, int mode,
	and pObjTrxTree* oxt.  The mode is used in the same manner as the
	Open function.


    G.  Managing Object Methods

        Objects may optionally have methods associated with them.  Each method
	is given a unique name within the object, and can take a single string
	parameter.  Three functions exist for managing methods.

	The first two functions, GetFirstMethod and GetNextMethod, work
	identically to their counterparts dealing with attributes.  The third
	function, ExecuteMethod, starts a method executing.  This function
	takes four parameters:  the inf_v pointer, the name of the method,
	the optional string parameter, and the oxt* pointer.


III READING THE NODE OBJECT

    The Node object has content which controls what resource(s) this driver
    will actually access, so it is important for the driver to access the node
    object's content.  If the driver's node objects are structure files (which
    is normally the case when dealing with a remote network resource), then the
    SN module can make opening the node object much more painless.  It also
    performs caching automatically to improve performance.

    Note tha the Node object will technically ALREADY BE OPEN as an object in
    the objectsystem.  The OSML does that for you.  If your driver will not
    use the SN/ST modules, then it should read the node object via the normal
    objRead() function, and write it via objWrite().  Your driver should NEVER
    objClose() the node object!  The OSML does that for you.

    An objectsystem driver will commonly configure itself by reading a text 
    file at the root of its object subtree.  There are two main modules 
    available for making this easier.  

    The normal way to manage object parameters is to use a structure file.  
    Structure files are a little more complicated, but allow for arrays of
    values for a given attribute name, as well as allowing for tree-
    structured hierarchies of attributes and values.  Structure files are 
    accessed via the stparse and st_node modules.  The stparse module provides
    access to the individual attributes and groups of attributes, and the
    st_node module loads and saves the structure file heirarchies as a whole.
    The st_node module also provides node caching to reduce disk activity and
    eliminate repeated parsing of one file.

    For example, if two sessions open two files, '/test1.rpt' and '/test2.rpt'
    the st_node (SN) module will cache the internal representations of these
    node object files, and for successive uses of these node objects, the
    physical file will not be re-parsed.  The file will be re-parsed if its
    timestamp changes.

    If the underlying object does not support the attribute "last_modification"
    (assumed to be the timestamp), then SN prints a warning.  In essence, this
    warning indicates that changes to the underlying object will not trigger
    the SN module to re-read the structure file defining the node object.
    Otherwise, the SN module keeps track of the timestamp, and if it changes,
    the node object is re-read and re-parsed.

    The driver's first course of action to obtain node object data is to open
    the node object with the SN module.  The SN module's functions are listed
    below:

        pSnNode snReadNode(pObject obj)

	    This function reads a Structure File from the already-open node
	    object which is passed in the "obj" parameter in the xxxOpen()
	    routine.  The "obj" parameter has an element, obj->Prev, which
	    is a link to the node object as opened by the previous driver in
	    the OSML's chain of drivers for handling this open().  All you
	    need to know to get the parsed node object is the following:

		pSnNode node;

		node = snReadNode(obj->Prev);

	    The returned node structure is managed by the SN module and need
	    not be nmFree()ed.  The only thing that must be done is that the
	    driver should increment the node structure's link count like this:

	        node->OpenCnt++;

	    When closing an object (and thus releasing a reference to the
	    Node structure), the driver should decrement the link count.

	pSnNode snNewNode(pObject obj, char* content_type)

	    This function creates a new node object with a given content type.
	    The open link count should be incremented as appropriate, as
	    before with snReadNode().

	        pSnNode node;

		node = snNewNode(obj->Prev, "system/structure");

	    The "system/structure" argument is the type that will be assigned
	    to the newly created node object.  Note that the underlying object
	    must already exist in order for this to create a node object as
	    that object's content.  Normally the OSML does this for you by 
	    commanding the previous driver (handling obj->Prev) to create the
	    underlying object in question.

	int snWriteNode(pSnNode node)

	    This function writes a node's internal representation back out to
	    the node file.  The node's status (node->Status) should be set to
	    SN_NS_DIRTY in order for the write to actually occur.  Otherwise,
	    snWriteNode() does nothing.
	
	int snDeleteNode(pSnNode node)

	    This function deletes a node file.  At this point, does not
	    actually delete the file but instead just removes the node's 
	    data structures from the internal node cache.

	int snGetSerial(pSnNode node)

	    This function returns the serial number of the node.  Each time the
	    node is re-read because of modifications to the file or is written
	    via snWriteNode because of modifications to the internal structure,
	    the serial number is increased.  This is a good way for a driver to
	    refresh internal information that it caches should it determine a
	    node object has changed.

    The stparse module is used to examine the parsed contents of the node file.
    A node file using the stparse module (and thus st_node module) has a
    structure file format; see StructureFile.txt.  The file format is a tree
    structure with objects, subobjects, and attributes.  The internal parsed
    representation is a tree, with each tree node being an object in the 
    structure file, and each node having attributes, each of which is also
    a tree node.  Thus, there are three different node types in the tree
    representation: the top-level ST_T_STRUCT element, which can contain 
    subgroups and attributes; a mid-level ST_T_SUBGROUP tree node, which has
    a content type, name, and can contain attributes and other subgroups, and
    lastly a ST_T_ATTRIB node which contains an attribute name and attribute
    values, either integer or string, and optional lists of such up to 64 items
    in length.  To use this module, include the file stparse.h.

    The following functions are used to manage a parsed structure file:

        pStructInf stParseMsg(pFile inp_fd, int flags)

	    This function is internal-use-only and is used by the st_node 
	    module to parse a structure file.

	pStructInf stParseMsgGeneric(void* src, int (*read_fn)(), int flags)

	    This function is also internal-use-only (unless you want to parse
	    the file manually without st_node's help) and is used to parse the
	    structure file when the structure file isn't being read from an
	    MTASK pFile descriptor.  This is always the case, as the structure
	    file data is being read from a pObject pointer.  In such a case,
	    src is the pObject pointer and read_fn is objRead().

	int stGenerateMsg(pFile out_fd, pStructInf info, int flags)

	    This function, also internal-use only, is used by the st_node
	    module to write a structure file whose internal representation
	    is given in the 'info' parameter.

	int stGenerateMsgGeneric(void* dst, int (*write_fn)(), pStructInf info,
	    int flags)

	    This function is stParseMsgGeneric's converse.

	pStructInf stCreateStruct(char* name, char* type)

	    This function creates a new top-level tree item of type
	    ST_T_STRUCT, with a given name and content-type.

	pStructInf stAddAttr(pStructInf inf, char* name)

	    This function adds a node of type ST_T_ATTRIB to either a 
	    ST_T_STRUCT or ST_T_SUBGROUP type of node, with a given name and
	    no values associated with that name (see AddValue, below).  The
	    new attribute tree node is linked under the 'inf' node passed,
	    and is returned.

	pStructInf stAddGroup(pStructInf inf, char* name, char* type)

	    This function adds a node of type ST_T_SUBGROUP to either a
	    ST_T_SUBGROUP or ST_T_STRUCT tree node, with a given name and
	    content type (content type such as 'report/query').

	int stAddValue(pStructInf inf, char* strval, int intval)

	    This function adds a value to an attribute, and can be called
	    multiple times on an attribute to add a list of values.  If 
	    'strval' is not null, a string value is added, otherwise an
	    integer value is added.  The string is NOT copied, but is
	    simply pointed-to.  If the string is non-static, and has a 
	    lifetime less than the ST_T_ATTRIB tree node, then the following
	    procedure must be used:

	        char* ptr;
		char* nptr;
		pStructInf attr_inf;

	        attr_inf = stAddAttr(my_parent_inf, "myattr");
		nptr = (char*)malloc(strlen(ptr)+1);
		if (!nptr) go_report_the_error_and_return;
		strcpy(nptr, ptr);
		stAddValue(attr_inf, nptr, 0);
		attr_inf->StrAlloc[0] = 1;

	    By following this method (making a copy of the string and then
	    setting the StrAlloc value for that string), when the StructInf
	    tree node is freed by the stparse module, the string will auto-
	    matically be freed as well.

	pStructInf stLookup(pStructInf inf, char* name)

	    This routine examines all sub-tree-nodes, both group and attribute
	    nodes, for a group or attribute with the given name.  If it finds
	    one, it returns a pointer to the sub-node, otherwise NULL.

	int stAttrValue(pStructInf inf, int* intval, char** strval, int nval)

	    This function returns the value of the given attribute in an
	    ST_T_ATTRIB tree node.  If a string value is being returned, pass
	    a pointer to the string pointer.  If an integer value is being
	    returned, pass a pointer to an integer.  The pointer not being used
	    must be left NULL.  'nval' can normally be 0, but if the attribute
	    has several values, setting nval to 1,2,3, etc., returns the 2nd,
	    3rd, 4th item, respectively.  This routing returns -1 if the 
	    attribute value did not exist or if the wrong type was requested.
	    It also returns -1 if 'inf' was NULL.

	    It is common practice to use the stLookup and stAttrValue functions
	    together to retrieve values, and search for an attribute StructInf
	    and retrieve its value in one operation:

		pStructInf inf;
		char* ptr;

	        if (stAttrValue(stLookup(inf, "myattr"),NULL,&ptr,0) == 0)
		    {
		    printf("%s is the value\n", ptr);
		    }

	int stFreeInf(pStructInf this)

	    This function is used to free a StructInf tree node.  It will
	    free any sub-nodes first, so if that is not desired, be sure
	    to disconnect them by removing them from the SubInf array and
	    appropriately adjusting the nSubInf counter, and setting the
	    SubInf array position to NULL.  This function also disconnects
	    the tree node from its parent, if any, so if the parent is 
	    already free()'d, be sure to set the node's Parent pointer to
	    NULL.  Any strings marked allocated with the StrAlloc flags will
	    be free()'d.

    It is also common practice to bypass the stXxx() functions entirely and
    access the elements of the StructInf structures themselves.  This is
    not forbidden, and may be done.  See the file stparse.h for a 
    description of the structure.  For example,

	    pStructInf inf;
	    int i;

	    for(i=0;i<inf->nSubInf;i++)
	        {
		if (inf->SubInf[i]->Type == ST_T_ATTRIB)
		    {
		    /** do stuff with attribute... **/
		    }
		}


IV  MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN CENTRALLIX

    Centrallix has its own memory manager that caches freshly-deallocated
    blocks of memory in lists according to size so that they can be quickly 
    reallocated.  This memory manager also catches double-freeing of blocks,
    making debugging of memory problems a little easier.

    In addition the memory manager provides statistics on the hit ratio of
    allocated blocks coming from the lists vs. malloc(), and information on
    how many blocks of each size/type are allocated out and cached.  This
    information can be invaluable in tracking down memory leaks.

    One caveat is that this memory manager does not provide a realloc()
    function, so the standard malloc(), free(), and realloc() must be used
    for blocks of memory that might grow in size.  This memory manager is also
    perhaps not the best to use for blocks of memory of arbitrary sizes, but
    rather is best for allocating structures quickly that are of a specific
    size and belong to specific objects, such as the StructInf structure or
    the SnNode structure, and others.  In short, use it for structures, but
    not for strings.

    Empirical testing has shown an increase of performance of around 50%
    or more in programs with the newmalloc module in use.

    The following are the functions for the newmalloc module:

        void* nmMalloc(int size)

	    This function allocates a block of the given 'size'.  It returns
	    NULL if the memory could not be allocated.

	void nmFree(void* ptr, int size)

	    This function frees the block of memory.  NOTE THAT THE CALLING
	    FUNCTION MUST KNOW THE SIZE OF THE BLOCK.  Getting this wrong is 
	    very bad.  For structures, this is trivial, just use sizeof() just
	    like with nmMalloc().

	void nmStats()

	    Prints out statistics on how well the memory manager is doing.

	void nmRegister(int size, char* name)

	    Registers a name with a block size.  This allows the memory 
	    manager to be intelligent when reporting block allocation counts.
	    The first argument is the size of the block, the second, an 
	    intelligent name for that size of block.  A size can have more than
	    one name.  This function is optional and need not be used except 
	    when tracking down memory leaks, but can be used freely.

	    Typically this function is called in a module's Initialize() 
	    function on each of the structures the module uses internally.

	void nmDebug()

	    Prints out a listing of block allocation counts, giving (by size):
	    1) number of blocks allocated but not yet freed, 2) number of 
	    blocks in the cache, 3) total allocations for this block size, and
	    a list of names (from nmRegister()) for that block size.

	void nmDeltas()

	    Prints a listing of all blocks whose allocation count has changed,
	    and by how much, since the last nmDeltas() call.  This function is
	    VERY USEFUL FOR MEMORY LEAK DETECTIVE WORK.

	void* nmSysMalloc(int size)

	    Allocates memory without using the block-caching algorithm.  This
	    is roughly equivalent to malloc(), but pointers returned by malloc
	    and this function are not compatible with each other - i.e., you
	    cannot free() something that was nmSysMalloc'ed, nor can you
	    nmSysFree() something that was malloc'ed.

	    This function is much better to use on variable-sized blocks of
	    memory.  nmMalloc is better for fixed-size blocks, such as for
	    data structures.

	void nmSysFree(void* ptr)

	    Frees a block of memory allocated by nmSysMalloc, nmSysStrdup, or
	    nmSysRealloc.

	void* nmSysRealloc(void* ptr, int newsize)
	
	    Changes the size of an allocated block of memory that was
	    obtained via nmSysMalloc or nmSysRealloc or nmSysStrdup.  The new
	    pointer may be different if the block had to be moved.  This is
	    the rough equivalent of realloc().  Usage Note:  If you are
	    realloc'ing a block of memory, and need to store pointers to
	    data somewhere inside the block, it is often better to store the
	    offset rather than a full pointer, as a pointer would become
	    invalid if a nmSysRealloc caused the block to move.

	char* nmSysStrdup(const char* str)

	    Allocates memory for a copy of the string str by using the
	    nmSysMalloc function, and then makes a copy of the string str.
	    It is a rough equivalent of strdup().  The resulting pointer can
	    be free'd using nmSysFree().

    Calling free() on a block obtained from nmMalloc() or calling nmFree() on a
    block obtained from malloc() will not crash the program.  Instead, it will
    result in either inefficient use of the memory manager, or a huge memory
    leak, respectively.  These practices will also render the statistics and 
    block count mechanisms useless.


V   OTHER UTILITY MODULES

    There are many other utility modules useful in Centrallix.  These include
    the xarray module, used for managing growable arrays; the xhash module,
    used for managing hash tables with no overflow problems and variable-length
    keys, the xstring module used for managing growable strings; the expression
    module used for compiling and evaluating expressions; and the mtsession 
    module, used for managing session-level variables and reporting errors.

    A.	XArray (XA) - Arrays

    The first is the xarray (XA) module.

        xaInit(pXArray this, int init_size)

	    This function initializes an allocated-but-uninitialized xarray.
	    It makes room for 'init_size' items initially, but this is only
	    an optimization.  A typical value for init_size is 16.

	xaDeInit(pXArray this)

	    This de-initializes an xarray, but does not free the XArray
	    structure itself.

	xaAddItem(pXArray this, void* item)

	    This adds an item to the array.  The item can be a pointer or an
	    integer (but ints will need a typecast on the function call).

	xaAddItemSorted(pXArray this, void* item, int keyoffset, int keylen)

	    This adds an item to the xarray, and keeps the array sorted.  The
	    value for sorting is expected to begin at offset 'keyoffset' and
	    continue for 'keylen' bytes.  This only works when pointers are
	    stored in the array, not integers.

	xaFindItem(pXArray this, void* item)

	    This returns the offset into the array's items of the given value.
	    An exact match is required.  The array's items are given below:

	        XArray xa;
		pStructInf inf;
		int item_id;

		xaInit(&xa, 16);

		[...]

		xaAddItem(&xa, inf);

		[...]

		item_id = xaFindItem(&xa, inf);
		inf == xa.Items[item_id];

	xaRemoveItem(pXArray this, int index)

	    This function removes an item from the xarray at the given index.

    B.	XHash (XH) - Hash Tables

    The xhash module provides an extensible hashing table interface.  The hash
    table is a table of linked lists of items, so collisions and overflows are
    not a problem as in conventional hash tables.

        int xhInit(pXHashTable this, int rows, int keylen)

	    This initializes a hash table, giving it the given number of rows,
	    and setting the key length.  For variable length keys (null-
	    terminated strings), use a key length of 0 (zero).  The 'rows'
	    should be an odd number, preferably prime, but does not need to be.
	    It SHOULD NOT be a power of 2.  It's value is an optimization
	    depending on how much data you expect to be in the hash table.  If
	    its value is set to 1, the hash search degenerates to a linear
	    array search.  The value should be large enough to comfortably 
	    accomodate the elements.  Typical values might be 31 or 255 (though
	    255 is not prime).

	int xhDeInit(pXHashTable this)

	    De-initializes a hash table.

	int xhAdd(pXHashTable this, char* key, char* data)
	    
	    Adds an item to the hash table, with a given key value and data
	    pointer.  Both data and key pointers must have a lifetime that
	    exceeds the time that they item is hashed.

	int xhRemove(pXHashTable this, char* key)

	    Removes an item with the given key value from the hash table.

	char* xhLookup(pXHashTable this, char* key)
	 
	    Returns the data pointer for a given key, or NULL if the item
	    is not found.

	int xhClear(pXHashTable this, int free_blk)

	    Clears all items from a hash table.  If free_blk is set to 1, the
	    items are free()'d as they are removed.

    C.	XString (XS) - Strings

    The xstring (XS) module is used for managing growable strings.  It is based
    on a structure containing a small initial string buffer to avoid string
    allocations for small strings, but with the capability of performing 
    realloc() operations to extend the string space for storing incrementally
    larger strings.  The interface to this module allows for strings to 
    contain arbitrary data, even null '\0' characters mid-string.  Thus it is
    useful as an extensible buffer module as well.

        int xsInit(pXString this)

	    Initializes an XString structure, to an empty string.

	int xsDeInit(pXString this)

	    Deinitializes an XString structure.

	int xsConcatenate(pXString this, char* text, int len)

	    Concatenates the string 'text' onto the end of the XString's value.
	    If len is -1, all data up to the null terminater is copied.  If 
	    len is set, all data up to length 'len' is copied, including 
	    possible '\0' characters.

	int xsCopy(pXString this, char* text, int len)

	    Copies the string 'text' into the XString.  Like xsConcatenate,
	    except that the previous string contents are overwritten.

	char* xsStringEnd(pXString this)

	    Returns a pointer to the end of the string.  Useful for finding
	    the end of the string without performing:

	        pXString xs;

		xs->String + strlen(xs->String)

	    since the xs module already knows the string length and does not
	    have to search for the null terminator.  Furthermore, since the
	    string can contain nulls, the above statement could produce
	    incorrect results in those situations.

    The contents of the XString can be easily referenced via:

        pXString xs;

	printf("This string is %s\n", xs->String);

    IMPORTANT NOTE:  Do not store pointers to values within the string while
    you are still adding text to the end of the string.  If the string ends
    up realloc()ing, your pointers will be incorrect.  Instead, if data in
    the middle of the string needs to be pointed to, store offsets from the
    beginning of the string, not pointers to the string.

    For example, this is WRONG:

        pXString xs;
	char* ptr;

	xsInit(&xs);
	xsConcatenate(&xs, "This is the first sentence.  ", -1);
	ptr = xsStringEnd(&xs);
	xsConcatenate(&xs, "This is the second sentence.", -1);
	printf("A pointer to the second sentence is '%s'\n", ptr);

    Instead, use pointer aritmetic and do this:

        pXString xs;
	int offset;

	xsInit(&xs);
	xsConcatenate(&xs, "This is the first sentence.  ", -1);
	offset = xsStringEnd(&xs) - xs->String;
	xsConcatenate(&xs, "This is the second sentence.", -1);
	printf("A pointer to the second sentence is '%s'\n",xs->String+offset);


    D.	Expression (EXP) - Expression Trees

    The expression (EXP) module is used for compiling, evaluating, reverse-
    evaluating, and passing parameters to expression strings.  The expression
    strings are compiled and stored in an expression tree structure.

    Expressions can be stand-alone expression trees, or they can take parameter
    objects.  A parameter object is an open object (from objOpen()) whose
    values (attributes) are referenced within the expression string.  By using
    such parameter objects, one expression can be compiled and then evaluated
    for many different objects with diverse attribute values.

    Expression evaluation results in the top-level expression tree node having
    the final value of the expression, which may be NULL, and may be an 
    integer, string, datetime, money, or double data type.  For example, the
    final value of

        :myobject:oneattribute == 'yes'

    would be integer 1 (true) if the attribute's value is indeed 'yes'.

    Reverse expression evaluation takes a given final value and attempts to 
    assign values to the parameter object attributes based on the structure
    of the expression tree.  It is akin to 'solving for X' in algebraic work,
    but isn't nearly that 'smart'.  For example, with the previous expression,
    if the final value was set to 1 (true), then an objSetAttrValue() 
    function would be issued to set myobject's 'oneattribute' to 'yes'.  Trying
    this with a final value of 0 (false) would result in no assignment to the
    attribute, since there would be no way of determining the proper value for
    that attribute (anything other than 'yes' would work).

    Reverse evaluation is typically very useful in updateable joins and views.

    Here are the basic expression functions:

        pExpression expCompileExpression(char* text, pParamObjects objlist, 
	    int lxflags, int cmpflags)

	    This function compiles a textual expression into an expression
	    tree.  The 'objlist' lists the parameter objects that are allowed
	    in the expression (see below for param objects maintenance 
	    functions).

	    The 'lxflags' parameter gives a set of lexical analyzer flags for
	    the compilation.  These flags alter the manner in which the input
	    string is tokenized.  A bitmask; possible values are:

	        MLX_F_ICASEK	automatically convert all keywords (non-quoted
				strings) to lowercase.
		MLX_F_POUNDCOMM	allow comment lines that begin with a # sign.
		MLX_F_CCOMM	allow c-style comments /* */
		MLX_F_CPPCOMM	allow c-plus-plus comments //
		MLX_F_SEMICOMM	allow semicolon comments ;this is a comment
		MLX_F_DASHCOMM	allow double-dash comments --this is a comment
		MLX_F_DASHKW	keywords can include the dash '-'.  Otherwise,
				the keyword is treated as two keywords with a
				minus sign between them.
		MLX_F_FILENAMES	Treat a non-quoted string beginning with a 
				slash '/' or dot-slash './' as a filename, and
				allow slashes and dots in the string without
				quotes needed.
		MLX_F_ICASER	automatically convert all reserved words to
				lowercase.  The use of this flag is highly
				recommended, and in some cases, required.
		MLX_F_ICASE	same as MLX_F_ICASER | MLX_F_ICASEK.

	    The 'cmpflags' is a bitmask parameter controlling the compilation
	    of the expression.  It can contain the following values:

	        EXPR_CMP_WATCHLIST	A list "value,value,value" is expected
					first in the expression.
		EXPR_CMP_ASCDESC	Recognize 'asc' and 'desc' following a
					value as flags to indicate sort order.
		EXPR_CMP_OUTERJOIN	Recognize the *= and =* syntax as outer
					joins.

	int expFreeExpression(pExpression this)

	    Frees an expression tree.

	int expEvalTree(pExpression this, pParamObjects objlist)

	    Evaluates an expression against a list of parameter objects.  If
	    the evaluation is successful, returns 0 or 1, otherwise -1.

	pParamObjects expCreateParamList()

	    Allocates a new parameter object list, with no parameters.

	int expFreeParamList(pParamObjects this)

	    Frees a parameter object list.

	int expAddParamToList(pParamObjects this, char* name, pObject obj, 
	    int flags)

	    Adds a parameter to the parameter object list.  The 'obj' pointer
	    may be left NULL during the expCompileExpression state of operation
	    but must be set to a value before expEvalTree is called.  Otherwise
	    the attributes that reference that parameter object will result in
	    NULL values in the expression (it's technically not an error).
	    Flags can be EXPR_O_CURRENT if the object is to be marked as the
	    current one, or EXPR_O_PARENT if it is to be marked as the parent
	    object.  Current and Parent objects can be referenced in an
	    expression like this:

	        :currentobjattr
		::parentobjattr

	    and is thus a shortcut to typing the full object name.

	int expModifyParam(pParamObjects this, char* name, pObject replace_obj)

	    This function is used to update a parameter object with a new open
	    pObject returned from objOpen or objQueryFetch.

	int expRemoveParamFromList(pParamObjects this, char* name)

	    This function removes a parameter object from the list.

	int expReverseEvalTree(pExpression tree, pParamObjects objlist)

	    This function reverse-evaluates a tree.

    The results of an expression evaluation can be accessed by examining the
    top-level tree node.  The following properties are useful:

        tree->DataType		The type of the final value, see 'Managing
				Object Attributes' above for types.

	tree->Flags		Contains the bit EXPR_F_NULL if the expression
				evaluated to NULL.

	tree->Integer		If DATA_T_INTEGER, this is the integer value.
	tree->String		If DATA_T_STRING, this is the string value.
	tree->Types.Double	If DATA_T_DOUBLE, this is the double value.
	tree->Types.Date	If DATA_T_DATETIME, this is the date/time value
	tree->Types.Money	If DATA_T_MONEY, this is the money value.

    There are several other EXP functions used to deal with aggregates and 
    a few other obscure features as well.  Aggregates are mostly handled 
    internally by Centrallix so further explanation should not be necessary
    here.


    E.	MTSession (MSS) - Basic Session Management

    The next utility module to be described here is the mtsession module (MSS).
    This module is used for session authentication, error reporting, and for
    storing session-wide variables such as the currently used date format, 
    current username, and current password (for issuing a login request to a
    remote server).  Care should be taken in the use of Centrallix that its
    coredump files are NOT in a world-readable location, as the password will
    be visible in the core file (or just ulimit the core file size to 0).

        char* mssUserName()

	    This function returns the current user name.

	char* mssPassword()

	    This function returns the password used to login to the Centrallix

	int mssSetParam(char* paramname, char* param)

	    This function sets a session parameter.  The parameter MUST be a 
	    string value.

	char* mssGetParam(char* paramname)

	    Returns the value of a session parameter.  Common ones are:

	        dfmt - current date format.
		mfmt - current money format.
		textsize - current max text size from a read of an object's
		    content via objGetAttrValue(obj, "objcontent", POD(&str))

	int mssError(int clr, char* module, char* message, ...)

	    Formats and caches an error message for return to the user.  If 
	    'clr' is set to 1, the assumption is that the error was JUST
	    discovered and no other module has had reason to do an mssError on
	    the current problem.  Setting 'clr' to 1 clears all error messages
	    from the current error message list and adds the current message.

	    'module' is a two-to-five letter abbreviation of the module 
	    reporting the error.  Typically it is all upper-case.

	    'message' is a string for the error message.  As this function will
	    accept a variable-length argument list, the strings '%d' and '%s'
	    can be included in 'message', and will be substituted with the
	    appropriate integer or string arguments, in a similar way to how
	    printf() works.

	int mssErrorErrno(int clr, char* module, char* message, ...)

	    Works much the same way as mssError, except checks the current
	    value of 'errno' and includes a description of any error stored
	    there.  Used primarily when a system call was at fault for an error
	    occurring.

    Errors that occur inside a session context are normally stored up and not
    printed until other MSS module routines are called to fetch those errors.
    Errors occurring outside a session context (such as in Centrallix's 
    network listener) are printed to Centrallix's standard output immediately.

    These mssError routines need not be called at every function nesting level
    when an error happens.  For example, if the expression compiler returns -1
    indicating that a compilation error occurred, it probably has set one or
    more error messages in the error list.  The calling function only needs
    to provide context information (e.g. _what_ expression failed compilation?)
    so that the user has enough information to locate the error.  And once the
    user is told the full context of the expression compilation error, no more
    information need be returned.

    Another example of this is the memory manager, which sets an error message
    indicating when an nmMalloc() failed.  The user probably does not care what
    kind of structure failed allocation -- he/she only needs to know that the
    hardware ran out of resources.  Thus, upon receiving a NULL from nmMalloc,
    in most cases another mssError need not be issued.

    The mssError() routines do not cause the calling function to return.  The
    function must still clean up after itself and return an appropriate value
    (like -1 or NULL) to indicate failure.


    F.	OSML Utility Functions

    The OSML provides a set of utility functions that make it easier to write
    drivers.  Most of them are named obj_internal_XxxYyy or similar.

	char* obj_internal_PathPart(pPathname path, int start, int length)

	    The Pathname structure breaks down a pathname into path elements,
	    which are text strings separated by the directory separator '/'.
	    This function takes the given Pathname structure, and returns
	    the number of path elements requested.  For instance, if you have
	    a path:

		/apps/kardia/data/Kardia_DB/p_partner/rows/1

	    that path would be stored internally in Centrallix as:

		./apps/kardia/data/Kardia_DB/p_partner/rows/1

	    To just return "Kardia_DB/p_partner", you could call:

		obj_internal_PathPart(pathstruct, 4, 2);

	    Note that return values from obj_internal_PathPart are only valid
	    until the next call to PathPart on the given pathname structure.

	int obj_internal_AddToPath(pPathname path, char* new_element)

	    This function lengthens the path by one element, adding
	    new_element on to the end of the path.  This function is
	    frequently useful for drivers in the QueryFetch routine where the
	    new child object needs to be appended onto the end of the given
	    path.
	    
	    This function returns < 0 on failure, or the index of the new
	    element in the path on success.

	int obj_internal_CopyPath(pPathname dest, pPathname src)

	    Copies a pathname structure.

	void obj_internal_FreePathStruct(pPathname path)
	
	    Frees a pathname structure.


VI  NETWORK CONNECTION FUNCTIONALITY

    Sometimes a driver will need to initiate a network connection.  This can
    be done via the MTASK module, which provides simple and easy TCP/IP
    connectivity.  

        pFile netConnectTCP(char* host_name, char* service_name, int flags)

	    This function connects to a server.  The host name or ascii string
	    for its ip address is in 'host_name'.  The name of the service
	    (from /etc/services) or its numeric representation in a string is
	    the 'service_name'.  Flags can normally be left 0.

	int netCloseTCP(pFile net_filedesc, int linger_msec, int flags)

	    This function closes a network connection, and optionally waits
	    up to 'linger_msec' milliseconds (1/1000 seconds) for any data
	    written to the connection to make it to the other end before
	    performing the close.  If linger_msec is set to 0, the connection
	    is aborted (reset).  The linger time can be set to 1000 msec or
	    so if no writes were performed on the connection prior to the
	    close.  If a large amount of writes were performed immediately
	    perior to the close, offering to linger for a few more seconds
	    (perhaps 5 or 10, 5000 or 10000 msec), might be a good idea.

	int fdWrite(pFile filedesc, char* buffer, int length, int offset, 
	    int flags)

	    This function writes data to a file descriptor, from a given
	    buffer and length, and to an optional seek offset and with some
	    optional flags.  Flags can be the following:

	        FD_U_NOBLOCK	If the write can't be performed immediately,
				don't perform it at all.
		FD_U_SEEK	The 'offset' value is valid.  Seek to it before
				writing.  Not valid for network connections.
		FD_U_PACKET	ALL of the data of 'length' in 'buffer' must
				be written.  Normal write() semantics in UNIX
				state that not all data has to be written,
				and the number of bytes actually written is
				returned.  Setting this flag makes sure all 
				data is really written before returning.

	int fdRead(pFile filedesc, char* buffer, int maxlen, int offset,
	    int flags)

	    The complement to the above routine.  Takes the same flags as the
	    above routine, except FD_U_PACKET means that all of 'maxlen' bytes
	    must be read before returning.  This is good for reading a packet
	    that is known to be exactly 'maxlen' bytes long, but which might
	    be broken up into fragments by the network (TCP/IP has a maximum
	    frame transmission size of about 1450 bytes).


VII PARSING DATA

    Centrallix provides a lexical analyzer library that can be used for 
    parsing many types of data.  This module, mtlexer (MLX) can either parse
    data from a pFile descriptor or from a string value.  This lexical analyzer
    is used by the expression compiler as well.  It is basically a very fancy
    string tokenizer.

        pLxSession mlxOpenSession(pFile fd, int flags)

	    This function opens a lexer session from a file source.  See the
	    'expression' module description previous in this document for more
	    information on the flags.  Some flags of use here but not mentioned
	    in that section are:

	        MLX_F_EOL	Return end-of-line as a token.  Otherwise, the
				end of a line is just considered whitespace.
		MLX_F_EOF	Return end-of-file as a token.  Otherwise,  if
				end of file is reached it is an error.
		MLX_F_IFSONLY	Only return string values separated by tabs,
				spaces, newlines, and carriage returns.  For
				example, normally the brace in "this{brace"
				is a token and that string will result in three
				tokens, but in IFSONLY mode it is just one 
				token.
		MLX_F_NODISCARD	This flag indicates to the lexer that the 
				calling function expects to be able to read
				data normally using fdRead() or another lexer
				session after the last token is read and the
				session is closed.  The lexer will then attempt
				to "unread" bytes that it buffered during the
				lexical analysis process (it does fdRead() 
				operations in 2k or so chunks).  If this flag
				is not specified, up to 2k of information after
				the last token will be discarded and further
				fdRead()s on the file descriptor will start at
				an undefined place in the file.

		MLX_F_ALLOWNUL	Allow NUL characters ('\0') in the input
				stream.  If this flag is not set, then NUL
				characters result in an error condition.  This
				prevents unwary callers from mis-reading a
				token returned by mlxStringVal if the token
				contains a NUL.  If ALLOWNUL is turned on,
				then the caller must ensure that it is safely
				handling values with NULs.  

	pLxSession mlxStringSession(char* str, int flags)

	    This function opens a lexer session from a text string.  Same as
	    the above function except that the flag MLX_F_NODISCARD makes no
	    sense for the string.

	int mlxCloseSession(pLxSession this)

	    Closes a lexer session.

	int mlxNextToken(pLxSession this)

	    Returns the type of the next token in the token stream.  Valid
	    token types are:

	        MLX_TOK_STRING		String value, as in a "string".
		MLX_TOK_INTEGER		Integer value.
		MLX_TOK_EQUALS		=
		MLX_TOK_OPENBRACE	{
		MLX_TOK_CLOSEBRACE	}
		MLX_TOK_ERROR		An error has occurred.
		MLX_TOK_KEYWORD		An unquoted string.
		MLX_TOK_COMMA		,
		MLX_TOK_EOL		End-of-line.
		MLX_TOK_EOF		End-of-file reached.
		MLX_TOK_COMPARE		<> != < > >= <= ==
		MLX_TOK_COLON		:
		MLX_TOK_OPENPAREN	(
		MLX_TOK_CLOSEPAREN	)
		MLX_TOK_SLASH		/
		MLX_TOK_PERIOD		.
		MLX_TOK_PLUS		+
		MLX_TOK_ASTERISK	*
		MLX_TOK_RESERVEDWD	Reserved word (special keyword).
		MLX_TOK_FILENAME	Unquoted string starting with / or ./
		MLX_TOK_DOUBLE		Double precision floating point.
		MLX_TOK_DOLLAR		$
		MLX_TOK_MINUS		-

	char* mlxStringVal(pLxSession this, int* alloc)

	    Gets the string value of the current token.  If 'alloc' is NULL,
	    only the first 255 bytes of the string will be returned, and the
	    rest will be discarded.  If 'alloc' is non-null and set to 0, the
	    routine will set 'alloc' to 1 if it needed to allocate memory for
	    a very long string, otherwise leave it at 0.  If 'alloc' is non-
	    null and set to 1, this routine will ALWAYS allocate memory for
	    the string, whether long or short.

	    This routine works no matter what the token type, and returns a
	    string representation of the token if not MLX_TOK_STRING.

	    This routine MAY NOT be called twice for the same token.

	    Note that if MLX_F_ALLOWNUL is enabled, there is no way to tell
	    from the return value of mlxStringVal() whether a NUL in the
	    returned string is the end-of-string terminator, or whether it
	    existed in the input data stream.  Thus, this function should not
	    be called when MLX_F_ALLOWNUL is being used.  Use mlxCopyToken
	    instead on MLX_TOK_STRING's, as it gives a definitive answer on
	    the token length.  (mlxStringVal can still be used on keywords
	    since those will never contain a NUL, by definition).

	int mlxIntVal(pLxSession this)

	    Returns the integer value of MLX_TOK_INTEGER tokens, or returns
	    the compare type for MLX_TOK_COMPARE tokens.  The compare type
	    is a bitmask of the following flags:

	        MLX_CMP_EQUALS
		MLX_CMP_GREATER
		MLX_CMP_LESS

	    For MLX_TOK_DOUBLE tokens, returns the whole part.

	double mlxDoubleVal(pLxSession this)

	    Returns a double precision floating point number for either
	    MLX_TOK_INTEGER or MLX_TOK_DOUBLE values.

	int mlxCopyToken(pLxSession this, char* buffer, int maxlen)

	    For use instead of mlxStringVal, copies the contents of the current
	    token to a string buffer, up to 'maxlen' characters.  Returns the
	    number of characters copied.  This function can be called multiple
	    times if more data needs to be read from the token.

	int mlxHoldToken(pLxSession this)

	    Basically causes the next mlxNextToken() to do nothing but return
	    the current token again.  Used for when a routine realizes after
	    mlxNextToken() that it has read one-too-many tokens and needs to
	    'put a token back'.

	int mlxSetOptions(pLxSession this, int options)

	    Sets options (MLX_F_xxx) in the middle of a lexer session.  The
	    options that are valid here are MLX_F_ICASE and MLX_F_IFSONLY.

	int mlxUnsetOptions(pLxSession this, int options)

	    Clears options (see above).

	int mlxSetReservedWords(pLxSession this, char** res_words)

	    Informs the lexer that a certain list of words are to be returned
	    as MLX_TOK_RESERVEDWD instead of MLX_TOK_KEYWORD.  The list of
	    words should be an array of character strings, with the last string
	    in the list NULL.  mtlexer does not copy this list, so it must be
	    static or have a lifetime greater than that of the lexer session.

	int mlxNoteError(pLxSession this)

	    Generates an mssError() message of this form:

	        MLX:  Error near '<token-string>'

	    NOTE:  the calling routine may have detected the error long after
	    the actual place where it occurred.  The MLX module just tries to
	    come close :)

	int mlxNotePosition(pLxSession this)

	    Generates an mssError() message of this form:

	        MLX:  Error at line ##

	    NOTE:  If using a StringSession instead of a pFile session, this
	    may not be accurate, as the string may have come from the middle
	    of a file somewhere.  Use with care.


VIII OBJECTSYSTEM DRIVER TESTING

    This section contains a list of things that can be done to test an
    objectsystem driver, to make sure that it is performing all basic
    operations normally.  We will use the test_obj command line interface for
    testing here.  For more information on test_obj commands, see the online
    Centrallix documentation at:  http://www.centrallix.net/docs/docs.php

    Testing for memory leaks for each of these items is strongly encouraged,
    by watching memory utilization using nmDeltas() during repetitive
    operations (e.g., nmDeltas(), open, close, nmDeltas(), open, close, and
    then nmDeltas() again).

    Testing for more general bugs using the "valgrind" tool is also strongly
    encouraged, via running these various tests in test_obj while test_obj is
    running under valgrind.

    Magic number checking on data structures is encouraged.  To use magic
    number checking, determine a magic number value for each of your
    structures, and code that as a constant #define in your code.  The magic
    number should be a 32-bit integer, possibly with 0x00 in either the 2nd or
    3rd byte of the integer.  Many existing magic number values can be found
    in the file "magic.h" in centrallix-lib.  The 32-bit integer is placed as
    the first element of the structure, and set using the macro SETMAGIC(),
    and then tested using the macros ASSERTMAGIC(), and less commonly,
    ASSERTNOTMAGIC().  ASSERTMAGIC() should be used any time a pointer to the
    structure crosses an interface boundary.  It also may be used at the entry
    to internal methods/functions, or when traversing linked lists of data
    structures, or when retrieving data structures from an array.

    When used in conjunction with nmMalloc() and nmFree(), ASSERTMAGIC also
    helps to detect the reuse of already-freed memory, since nmFree() tags the
    first four bytes of the memory block with the constant MGK_FREEMEM.
    nmFree() also looks for the constant MGK_FREEMEM in the magic number slot
    to detect already-freed memory (so do not use that same constant for your
    own magic numbers).

    To properly test under Valgrind, centrallix-lib must be compiled with the
    configure flag --enable-valgrind-integration turned on.  This disables
    nmMalloc block caching (so that valgrind can properly detect memory leaks
    and free memory reuse), and it provides better information to valgrind's
    analyzer regarding MTASK threads.

    The term "MUST", as used here, means that the driver will likely cause
    problems if the functionality is not present.

    The term "SHOULD" indicates behavior which is desirable, but may not cause
    problems if not fully implemented.

    The term "MAY" refers to optional, but permissible, behavior.

    A.	Object opening, closing, creation, and deletion

	1.  Any object in the driver's subtree, including the node object
	    itself, MUST be able to be opened using objOpen() and then closed
	    using objClose().  Although it does more than just open and close,
	    the "show" command in test_obj can be useful for testing this.

	2.  Objects MUST be able to be opened regardless of the location of
	    the node object in the ObjectSystem.  For example, don't just test
	    the driver with the node object in the top level directory of the
	    ObjectSystem - also try it in other subdirectories.

	3.  New objects within the driver's subtree SHOULD be able to be
	    created using objOpen with OBJ_O_CREAT, or using objCreate().  The
	    flags OBJ_O_EXCL and OBJ_O_TRUNC should also be supported, where
	    meaningful.

	4.  Where possible, OBJ_O_AUTONAME should be supported on object
	    creation.  With this, the name of the object will be set to "*" in
	    the pathname structure, and OBJ_O_CREAT will also be set.  The
	    driver should automatically determine a suitable "name" for the
	    object, and subsequent calls to objGetAttrValue on "name" should
	    return the determined name.  A driver MAY choose to return NULL
	    for "name" until after certain object properties have been set and
	    an objCommit operation performed.  A driver MUST NOT return "*"
	    for the object name unless "*" is truly the name chosen for the
	    object.

	5.  A driver SHOULD support deletion of any object in its subtree with
	    the exception of the node object itself.  Deletion may be done
	    directly with objDelete(), or on an already-open object using
	    objDeleteObj().  A driver MAY refuse to delete an object if the
	    object still contains deletable sub-objects.  Some objects in the
	    subtree might inherently not be deletable apart from the parent
	    objects of said objects.  In those cases, deletion should not
	    succeed.

    B.	Object attribute enumeration, getting, and setting.

	1.  The driver MUST NOT return system attributes (name, inner_type,
	    and so forth) when enumerating with objGetFirst/NextAttr.

	2.  The driver does not need to handle objGetAttrType on the system
	    attributes.  The OSML does this.

	3.  The driver SHOULD support the attribute last_modification if at
	    all reasonable.  Not all objects can have this property however.

	4.  The driver SHOULD support the attribute "annotation" if reasonable
	    to do so.  Database drivers should have a configurable "row
	    annotation expression" to auto-generate annotations from existing
	    row content, where reasonable.  The driver MAY permit the user to
	    directly set annotation values.  The driver MUST return an empty
	    string ("") for any annotation values that are unavailable.

	5.  Drivers MUST coherently name EVERY object.  Names MUST be unique
	    in any given "directory".

	6.  Drivers MAY choose to omit some attributes from normal attribute
	    enumeration.

	7.  The "show" command in test_obj is a good way to display a list of
	    attributes for an object.

	8.  Attribute enumeration, retrieval, and modification MUST work
	    equally well on objects returned by objOpen() and objects returned
	    by objQueryFetch().

	9.  If a driver returns an attribute during attribute enumeration,
	    then that attribute MUST return a valid type via objGetAttrType.

	10. A driver MUST return -1 and error with a "type mismatch" type of
	    error from objGet/SetAttrValue, if the data type is inappropriate.

	11. A driver MAY choose to perform auto-conversion of data types on
	    certain attributes, but SHOULD NOT perform such auto conversion
	    on a widespread wholesale basis.

	12. A driver MAY support the DATA_T_CODE attribute data type.

	13. Drivers MAY support DATA_T_INTVEC and DATA_T_STRINGVEC.

	14. Drivers MAY support objAddAttr and objOpenAttr.

	15. Drivers MAY support methods on objects.  Objects without any
	    methods should be indicated by a NULL return value from the method
	    enumeration functions.

	16. When returning attribute values, the value MUST remain valid at
	    least until the next call to objGetAttrValue, objSetAttrValue, or
	    objGetAttrType, or until the object is closed, whichever occurs
	    first.  Drivers MUST NOT require the caller to free attribute
	    memory.

	17. When objSetAttrValue is used, drivers MUST NOT depend on the
	    referenced value (in the POD) being valid past the end of the call
	    to objSetAttrValue().

    C.	Object querying (for subobjects)

	1.  If an object cannot support queries for subobjects, the OpenQuery
	    call SHOULD fail.

	2.  If an object can support the existence of subobjects, but has no
	    subobjects, the OpenQuery should succeed, but calls to QueryFetch
	    MUST return NULL.

	3.  Objects returned by QueryFetch MUST remain valid even after the
	    query is closed using QueryClose.

	4.  Objects returned by QueryFetch MUST also be able to be passed to
	    OpenQuery to check for the existence of further subobjects, though
	    the OpenQuery call is permitted to fail as in (C)(1) above.

	5.  Any name returned by objGetAttrValue(name) on a queried subobject
	    MUST be able to be used to open the same object using objOpen().

	6.  Drivers which connect to resources which are able to perform
	    sorting and/or selection (filtering) of records or objects SHOULD
	    use the OBJ_QY_F_FULLSORT and OBJ_QY_F_FULLQUERY flags (see
	    previous discussion) as well as pass on the sorting and filtering
	    expressions to the remote resource so that resource can do the
	    filtering and/or sorting.

	7.  If the driver's remote resource can filter and/or sort, but can
	    only do so imperfectly (e.g., the resource cannot handle the
	    potential complexity of all sorting/selection expressions, but can
	    handle parts of them), then OBJ_QY_F_FULLSORT and/or OBJ_QY_F_FULL-
	    QUERY MUST NOT be used.  However the remote resource MAY still
	    provide partial sorting and/or selection of data.

	8.  Drivers SHOULD NOT use OBJ_QY_F_FULLSORT and OBJ_QY_F_FULLQUERY if
	    there is no advantage to letting the resource perform these
	    operations (usually, however, if the resource provides such
	    functionality, there is advantage to letting the resource perform
	    those operations.  However, the coding burden to provide the
	    filtering and sorting expressions to the resource, and in the
	    correct format for the resource, may be not worth the work).

	9.  Testing of query functionality can be done via test_obj's "query",
	    "csv", and "ls" (or "list") commands.  To test for nested querying
	    of objects returned from QueryFetch, a SUBTREE select can be used
	    with the "query" or "csv" commands.

	10. Drivers which support full sorting or full querying MUST be able
	    to handle the attribute "name" in the expression tree for the sort
	    or query criteria.  The "name" attribute SHOULD be mapped to an
	    expression which reflects how "name" is constructed for objects,
	    such as changing "name" to "convert(varchar, prikeyfield1) + '|' +
	    convert(varchar, prikeyfield2)" or whatever is appropriate.
