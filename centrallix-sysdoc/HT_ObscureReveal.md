1.  INTRODUCTION....

    Many times, an onscreen widget needs to know when it is being revealed (or
    shown) to the user, and also when it is being obscured (or hidden) from the
    user.  In addition, the widget may need the opportunity to cancel the
    reveal or obscure action, for instance when a window is being closed
    which contains a form with unsaved modifications.

    User agents currently do not provide a good way to obtain this information
    in a 'natural' manner based on layer or "div" DOM object visibility 
    changes.  Though the visibility property can be "watched", it still
    depends on the visibility of container(s), and so a better method is
    needed.  Furthermore, some widgets may cause an obscure operation without
    actually setting a layer's visibility to 'hidden'.

    The purpose of this API is to define and describe a mechanism for providing
    obscure/reveal notification and hooks in a cross-browser manner within the
    Centrallix framework.


2.  MECHANISM....

    Much of this mechanism is required to be asynchronous, and thus callback-
    driven, as a result of the requirements of being able to cancel an
    obscure or reveal event.

    Events called on Listeners:

	Reveal		- A widget is 'revealing' a content area to the user,
			  making it visible and thus accessible to the user.
	Obscure		- A widget is 'obscuring', or hiding, a content area
			  from the user, making it potentially inaccessible.
	RevealCheck	- A widget desires to reveal a content area, and needs
			  to give objects in that content area a chance to
			  "veto" the reveal operation.
	ObscureCheck	- A widget desire to obscure a content area, and needs
			  to give objects in that content area a chance to 
			  "veto" or cancel the obscure operation.

    Events for Triggerers:

	RevealFailed	- The reveal request has failed because some listener 
			  vetoed the operation.
	ObscureFailed	- The obscure request has failed because some listener 
			  vetoed the operation.
	RevealOK	- The reveal request has succeeded.  The triggerer 
			  should proceed with its reveal operation.
	ObscureOK	- The obscure request has been accepted, and the
			  triggerer should proceed with the obscure operation.
    
    Entities:

	Listener	- A widget which is listening for new Reveal or
			  Obscure events.  This widget will have the 
			  opportunity to cancel such events in the context
			  of the RevealCheck or ObscureCheck events.  The
			  listener must be a layer (or DIV).
	Triggerer	- A widget which has the capability of revealing or
			  obscuring content areas.  Internally, a Triggerer
			  is a Listener as well, though the Triggerer itself
			  does not do any Listener processing.  The Triggerer
			  must be a layer (or DIV) which physically contains
			  the content that is being obscured or revealed.
	Page		- The page - top-level widget which has the ability to
			  reveal or obscure the entire application - reveal
			  on application load, and obscure on application
			  termination or closure.  The Page is a Triggerer
			  only without needing to listen for any events.

    Operation:

	A.  Triggerer or Page registers:

	    When the triggerer or page registers with the obscure/reveal
	    system, a set of properties is created on that DIV object which
	    control the obscure/reveal operation.  These properties are
	    as follows:

	    __pg_reveal:
	    
		An Array() of listeners contained within this triggering layer

	    __pg_reveal_visible:

		A boolean value indicating whether or not the current 
		triggerer is obscured (false) or revealed (true).  Initially
		set to false.

	    __pg_reveal_parent_visible:

		A boolean value indicating whether or not the parent triggerer
		(or Page object) is obscured or revealed.  For a page object,
		this is always set to true since the page object has no
		parent.  Otherwise it is set to the __pg_reveal_visible 
		property value for the parent triggerer (as adjusted by the
		__pg_reveal_parent_visible property of the parent).

	    __pg_reveal_listener_fn:

		The function to be called when the parent triggerer is obscured
		or revealed.  This is the same type of function as the ones
		in a Listener.  This function will be null for the Page.

	    __pg_reveal_triggerer_fn:

		This is normally set to the Reveal() function on a triggerer,
		and is called with triggerer events.  Note that for a listener,
		the Reveal() function is pointed to by the listener_fn, but for
		a triggerer, Reveal() is pointed to by the triggerer_fn.  They
		have different purposes, but Reveal() is always the name of the
		event callback in either case.

	    __pg_reveal_busy:

		Indicates whether an operation is already in progress; if it
		is, the triggerer will not be able to invoke events.  This
		prevents an aggressive triggerer from 'getting ahead' of the
		notification mechanism.

	    Once these properties have been created, if the triggerer is not
	    the Page, then a listener setup is also done so that the 
	    obscure/reveal mechanism can receive obscure/reveal events from
	    the parent triggerer on behalf of the current triggerer.  The
	    registration function returns the visibility status of the
	    parent triggerer, which is then used to initialize the triggerer's
	    __pg_reveal_parent_visible property (see above).

	B.  Listener registers:

	    When a listener registers, first the following property is created
	    in the listener:

	    __pg_reveal_listener_fn

	    which is the same as listed above for a Triggerer.  This function,
	    if not already set up, will be set to the Reveal() method on the
	    listener.  For a Triggerer, the function will have already been
	    set up for internal reveal/obscure system operation.

	    Next, a search is done for the triggerer containing this listener,
	    by following the parentLayer or parentNode chain until an object
	    with a __pg_reveal array is found.  When it is, the listener is
	    added to the triggerer's __pg_reveal array. 

	    The registration routine then returns the current value of the
	    triggerer's __pg_reveal_visible property.

	C.  Triggerer sends Obscure/Reveal/ObscureCheck/RevealCheck event.

	    ** For Check events:

	    If the new status matches the current triggerer's value of 
	    __pg_reveal_visible, then nothing is done and the call is 
	    ignored entirely.

	    If the parent triggerer is not visible, then only the 
	    __pg_reveal_visible value is updated and no other operation
	    takes place.

	    Next, the RevealCheck or ObscureCheck sequences of events 
	    commences (see below).

	    ** For non-Check events:

	    The __pg_reveal_visible value is updated, and Reveal or Obscure 
	    events are sent to all listeners connected with this triggerer.

	D.  Triggerer is itself receives Reveal/Obscure/RevealCheck/etc event

	    When the triggerer is obscured or revealed because the parent 
	    triggerer changed its obscure/reveal status and called its
	    listeners' __pg_reveal_listener_fn() functions, the following 
	    events commence.

	    First, the value of __pg_reveal_parent_visible is checked, and if
	    the reveal/obscure event is the same as the current status, nothing
	    is done.

	    Next, the value of __pg_reveal_visible is checked, and if it is
	    different than the requested status (i.e., the event is Reveal and
	    visible is false, etc.), then the event is sent to all listeners
	    registered with the current triggerer.  For sending of Check
	    type events, see below.

	E.  RevealCheck or ObscureCheck event needs to be sent to listeners
	    on a triggerer.

	    The sending of the Check events is serialized.  To do this, the
	    Check event is sent only to the first listener on the list.  That
	    listener then has the responsibility of telling the reveal/obscure
	    mechanism, via a callback, whether to allow the Reveal or Obscure
	    event to proceed; the callbacks are:

		pg_reveal_check_ok(e)
		pg_reveal_check_veto(e)

		    Called with e = event object passed to Reveal().  The
		    properties of 'e' will be:

			- event name (reveal, obscure, revealcheck, etc.)
			- triggerer
			- parent triggerer's 'e' object if this triggerer
			  did not originate the event.
			- any other context info needed by the triggerer(s)

	    The callbacks can be called in the context of the current script,
	    or at a later point, but one of the two MUST be called in response
	    to the Check event.

	F.  Check OK callback occurs from a listener

	    The triggerer then looks up the next listener in its list, and if
	    there is another one, it sends the Check event to the next 
	    listener in the list.  It can keep a counter of how many listeners
	    have been notified in the 'e' structure (see above).

	    If all listeners had been notified, then the Check event has passed
	    all listeners.  If this triggerer caused the original event, then
	    it should then respond with a RevealOK or ObscureOK event to the 
	    triggerer.

	    If the triggerer was responding to a Check event from the parent
	    triggerer, then it should do an OK callback on the parent 'e'
	    value (which should be kept in the triggerer's own 'e' structure).

	G.  Check VETO callback occurs from a listener

	    The triggerer then stops looking up more listeners from its list.
	    The check has failed.

	    If the triggerer initiated the event, its own Reveal function
	    should be called with the event RevealFailed or ObscureFailed,
	    as needed, event to let the triggerer know that its requested
	    operation has failed.

	    If the triggerer did not initiate the event but was responding to
	    a Check event from its parent triggerer, it should do a VETO
	    callback on the parent 'e' value (see above).


3.  API....

    This section describes the API for the obscure/reveal subsystem (I'll call
    it "ORS" from here forward just for brevity).

    ORS <-> Listener API:

	pg_reveal_register_listener(l) - this call is made when the Listener
	    registers itself to receive Obscure/Reveal/Check events from
	    the ORS.  'l' is the main object of the listener, and must have
	    the following interface:

		Reveal() - a function which is called when an event occurs.  It
		    will be called with an ORS event object 'e' which will
		    contain the following properties that will be of interest
		    to the Listener:

			eventName:  'Reveal', 'Obscure', 'RevealCheck', or
				    'ObscureCheck'.

	pg_reveal_check_ok(e) - this call is a callback from the Listener
	    back to the ORS indicating that the RevealCheck or ObscureCheck
	    event has passed.  The 'e' parameter must be that which was 
	    passed to Reveal().  This should never be called in response to
	    a plain 'Reveal' or 'Obscure' event!

	pg_reveal_check_veto(e) - the complement to the above callback
	    routine, to be called when RevealCheck or ObscureCheck must be
	    cancelled (reasons might be unsaved data in a component that is
	    about to be obscured, or unavailable/irrelevant data in a
	    component that was going to be revealed).

	Note that on a RevealCheck or ObscureCheck event, the Listener MUST
	ALWAYS call either of pg_reveal_check_ok or pg_reveal_check_veto!
	There are NO exceptions to this.  However, the callbacks don't have
	to be called in the same function call context as the Reveal()
	method was invoked - a dialog, for instance, can request that the user
	specify what must be done with unsaved data.

	Until the Listener calls the OK or VETO calls listed above, the
	ORS will 'lock' the triggerer so that it cannot generate any more
	events.

    ORS <-> Triggerer API:

	pg_reveal_register_triggerer(l): registers an object onscreen to 
	    generate events.  The triggerer must register *before* its
	    child objects have a chance to register as listeners, or else
	    operation is undefined.  The 'l' parameter is the main layer
	    object of the triggerer, and should have a 'Reveal()' callback
	    for delivery of triggerer events:

		Reveal() - a function which is called when a triggerer event
		    occurs.  Such events are the result of a failed or
		    successful reveal or obscure operation.  It will be 
		    called with a context value 'e' which has the following
		    properties:

			eventName:  'RevealOK', 'RevealFailed', 'ObscureOK',
			    or 'ObscureFailed'.
			c: the context value passed to pg_reveal_event().

	pg_reveal_event(l,c,e_name): this is the routine a triggerer uses to
	    initiate an event.  'l' is the triggerer's main object, and 
	    'e_name' is 'Reveal', 'Obscure', 'RevealCheck', or 'ObscureCheck'.
	    'c' is the context argument; it may be anything the triggerer 
	    desires, and will be passed back to the triggerer's Reveal() event
	    callback when the Obscure/Reveal Failed/OK events occur.

	    Note that OK/Failed callbacks are *only* sent for 'Check' type
	    events.  The standard 'Reveal' and 'Obscure' types automatically
	    succeed.

	    If the triggerer for some reason is not permitted to initiate an
	    event at this point in time, pg_reveal_event() returns false,
	    otherwise true.  The triggerer should respond by refusing to
	    continue its reveal/obscure operation that was the reason for the
	    event.

	    The triggerer will receive an OK or Failed event at a later point
	    to inform it whether or not its requested event succeeded or not.
	    On an OK event, it should continue with its reveal or obscure
	    operation (such as opening/closing a window or tab page).  Thus
	    the triggerer should embed enough information in 'c' to allow it
	    to continue its action when 'c' is passed back to RevealOK or
	    ObscureOK.


4.  NONVISUAL AND RELATED WIDGETS: FORM, TABLE, OSRC....

    The form and objectsource in particular present a challenge to this 
    obscure/reveal mechanism because they are nonvisual.  The table is included
    in this discussion since it is integrally a part of the form/osrc setup.

    The objectsource in particular is an issue because it is nonvisual and
    thus cannot naturally be obscured or revealed.  Thus, for objectsource
    and form, the obscure/reveal mechanism requires some additional work.  In
    this case the visual presentation components for this data (form elements
    and the table widget) are used to 'pass on' that information to the
    osrc.

    The osrc currently will use the information to handle auto-querying on
    'first reveal' or on 'each reveal'.  The form will use the information
    to pop a squawk dialog should unsaved information be threatened with
    obscuring.

    Form elements should pass on the obscure/reveal data to the form via 
    the form's Reveal() method which conforms to the Reveal() method for
    a listener.  If the form element does not have a form associated
    with it, then it should handle such events itself (including doing
    veto/ok operations on check events).

    The form and table should call the Reveal method on the osrc when
    any part of the form or table first is revealed (made visible).  They
    should call Obscure() on the osrc when the last part of the form or
    table is obscured from the user's reach.


5.  FUTURE DIRECTIONS....

    This is an initial implementation of the obscure/reveal subsystem.  The
    following future directions are foreseen:

	1.  Triggerer and Listener functionality in one object

	    Sometimes an object may need to act as a Listener and Triggerer
	    simultaneously, preventing the builtin pg_reveal_internal()
	    routine from passing the events down the chain.  Some provision
	    needs to be made for this.

	2.  Generic messaging model

	    Perhaps even better would be a generic messaging model by which
	    these kinds of events could be sent up or down the widget
	    hierarchy, generically instead of specific to the obscure/reveal
	    mechanism.  Different systems use different terminology for this
	    type of mechanism such as 'messaging' or 'broadcasting'.

	3.  Stronger parent/child widget association

	    Currently, widget parent/child associations in the generated
	    DHTML page are indirect: the subwidgets are 'generally' rendered 
	    within a layer that belongs to the parent widget, but may not
	    be the 'main layer' of the parent widget.  We may need to develop
	    a stronger parent/child widget tree in the generated DHTML to 
	    help aid the functioning of a generic messaging model or even of
	    the obscure/reveal system itself.
