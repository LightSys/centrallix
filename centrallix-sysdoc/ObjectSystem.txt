*********************************

This file was created by Seth Bird (Thr4wn) to introduce developers to
how to use the Object System in a way that should (hopefully), reduce
the learning curve.

Please edit this file if there are any mistakes.

Also, online documentation can be found at http://www.centrallix.net/docs/docs.php

*********************************

Usage of the Object System is handled via a (currently) not
well-documented API (that I could find). One uses the Object System by
creating an Object Session (via objOpenSession() wich returns an
ObjSession struct instance).

the API for interacting with the OS can be found in
centrallix/include/obj.h
