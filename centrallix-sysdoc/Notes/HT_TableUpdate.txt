On load:
    1. Place header row outside scroll area
    2. Render header row

On data:
    1. View range will have been decided (e.g., rows 1-30)
    2. Begin at first visible record
	a. Fetch an unused visual row from row cache, or create a new one if we haven't reached our create limit
	b. If visual row not available, scan for one to discard from hidden top or bottom of visible rows
	c. Populate the row with data and with the correct colors, etc.

On event:
    1. Determine needed visual window range
	a. If on load, this will be rows 1 through ceil(vis_scroll_area_height / max_rowheight)
	b. If on down sb click, this will be (last_row_fully_displayed + 1) through that plus the above.
	c. If on up sb click, adjust similarly in reverse based on first row fully displayed
	d. If on down button, bring one more record into view at the bottom
	e. If on up button, bring one more record into view at the top
    2. Display records that can be displayed now
    3. Determine needed data to fill in remaining rows
    4. Request additional data, if possible
    5. On data delivery, go back to step 2

Row list:
    this.rows = {}
    this.rows.first
    this.rows.last
    this.rows.firstvis
    this.rows.lastvis
    this.rows[rowslot]
