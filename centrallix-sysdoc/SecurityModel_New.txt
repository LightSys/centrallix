OVERVIEW

    This document describes the Centrallix Security Subsystem (CXSS), a role-
    based policy-driven security model.


TERMINOLOGY

    Subject: the user that is engaging in a certain type of access.  This user
	may be represented by their user name, or by their role or user group.

    Object: the item in the Centrallix system that is being accessed, such as a
	file, database table row, structure file subgroup, etc.  Objects are
	identified primarily by their pathname, but also by the application
	context to which they belong and by their object type.

    Access Type: this is a very fine-grained privilege that a Subject may use
	when accessing an Object.  Access types include read, write, observe,
	delete, create, exec, and noexec, as well as a couple of internal
	access types (delegate, endorse) related to policy delegation and
	endorsement granting.

    Endorsement: this is a very high-level privilege that a Subject may have,
	and which may be used by the security policy to determine what access
	types the Subject may engage in with regard to different Objects.

    Policy: the policy is a collection of policy files which work together to
	determine what types of Access Types a given Subject may engage in with
	regard to a given Object.  A Policy contains a set of Rules, as well as
	a set of definitions of object types, endorsement types, application
	(domain) types, and roles.  Multiple policy files are required because
	installable applications within Centrallix will normally have special
	knowledge of roles, permissions, and such, that should be honored.

    Rule: a single item within a policy which specifies whether an access
	should be allowed or denied in a specific situation.  Policies contain
	a set of rules which provide access control coverage over a potentially
	complex system.  Rules can match certain Subjects, certain Objects,
	require certain Endorsements, relate to certain Access Types, require
	certain Object authorship (and with a certain level of assurance), and
	may take one or more Actions with regard to the request for access to
	the Object.  The rule may also match against the Object's attributes,
	or in the case of modification, the attributes before and/or after a
	proposed change.

    Action: the result of a rule matching a given access to an object.  Actions
	may include allowing access, denying access, or adding a new
	Endorsement to the user's session in the context of the current
	operation.

    Delegation: a policy file may delegate control to another policy file for a
	specific subset of Objects in the system.  In such a situation, the
	main policy retains veto ability in that it can still deny access, but
	the sub policy file has greater knowledge of its domain (application
	context) and is in a better position to mediate access to that 
	application's objects.

    Domain: a subtree of the Centrallix ObjectSystem which is subject to the
	control of a particular policy file, as delegated by other policy
	files.  Typically, this represents an "application", or a "module"
	within an application.

    Group: a set of users specified by the administrator of the system.

    Role: a "sense" that a user can engage in which provides access to a
	specific subset of functionality.  Roles may be set up to be mutually
	exclusive in order to implement certain separation of duties types of
	controls.


APPLICATION PROPERTIES

    Applications and components will gain the following properties in order to
    manage user endorsements:

	A.  add_endorsements = string[,string ...]

	    This property allows an application or component to add an
	    endorsement to the context that the user is operating within.  If
	    specified with a subquery-style SQL statement, multiple
	    endorsements can be added from a database backend, for instance.

    All widgets can have the following properties:

	A.  require_endorsements = string[,string ...]

	    This specifies a list of one or more endorsements that a widget
	    requires in order to render property.


SUBJECT IDENTIFIERS

    Subject identifiers must distinguish between a specific user, a group that
    a user is in, or a role that a user is acting in.

    There are four types of subject identifiers that don't identify a specific
    subject.  These are a:, l:, c:, and e:, and are described below.

    u:username	- A user with logon 'username'
    g:grpname	- A group with group name 'grpname'
    r:rolename	- A role with role name 'rolename'
    a:		- A user who has not authenticated ('anonymous')
    l:		- A logged-in/authenticated user
    c:		- The creator/author of a given object
    e:		- Everyone

    The c: subject identifier is context-dependent.  It is used to refer to the
    creator of a given object, and so is dependent on which object is being
    accessed.


OBJECT/ATTRIBUTE IDENTIFIERS

    The object identifier will have the capability of referring to an object
    type, specific object, attribute for a type of object, or attribute within
    a specific object.  It may also refer to all objects within a given
    application.

    The general object ID specification is formatted thus:

	appname:objecttype:objectname:attrname

    In specific instances, the following are also accepted.  An unspecified
    name or type is a wildcard.

    A.	All objects belonging to a specific application:

	appname:::

    B.	All attributes of a given name within an application:

	appname:::attrname

    C.	All objects of a specific type in an application:

	appname:objecttype::

    D.	A specific object within an application:

	appname:objecttype:objectname:
	appname:objecttype:/path/to/objectname:
	appname:objecttype:/objects/within/*:

    E.	An attribute of a type of object in an app:

	appname:objecttype::attrname

    F.	An attribute of a specific object:

	appname:objecttype:objectname:attrname


ENDORSEMENT IDENTIFIERS

    Likewise, endorsements also have an application-specific naming convention:

	appname:endorsementname

    The appname 'system' is used for internal Centrallix endorsements.  A list
    of internal endorsements follows:

	system:from_application	- provides assurance that the current context
				  was invoked from a running application that
				  has a valid SGA Key (session management and
				  CSRF token).  Reports and other objects that
				  make changes without additional user
				  interaction, or use large amounts of system
				  resources, may require this endorsement to
				  prevent a security compromise or denial of
				  service attack.


ACCESS TYPES

    There are seven primary access types that Centrallix uses:

    create	- permission to create a new object of the type
    delete	- permission to delete an object of the type
    observe	- permission to observe that an object exists
    read	- permission to read the content of an object or attribute
    write	- permission to write to an object or attribute
    exec	- permission to 'execute' an object, which usually means
		  opening it using its associated objectsystem driver,
		  instead of just opening the underlying object.
    noexec	- permission to open an object without automatic 'execution',
		  basically controlling the use of open-as (ls__type)
		  processing and the EXEC/NOEXEC flags on queries and opens.

    These two access types are used specifically for controlling the
    applicability of a security policy file, and for controlling when an
    endorsement may be added to a user's session:

    delegate	- permission for a particular .pol file to be used to modify
		  the access permissions of a user or users.
    endorse	- permission for a particular .app or .cmp (or similar) file
		  to add a particular endorsement to a user's session.

    Access Type interactions:

    - If observe is allowed but read is not, the subject will be able to
      notice the existence of the object but not view its attributes or
      contents.

    - If read is allowed but observe is not, the subject will be able to
      access the object only if the subject already knows the object's name
      (i.e., location in the objectsystem).  The object will not show up in
      a subobject query on its parent, unless the object is a node object
      and the query is done without EXEC (e.g., say an object of a database
      node type has restricted access; it would not show up if the query
      were set up to exec all nodes it finds.  If the query was running in
      a noexec manner, the nodes would not be invoked and the underlying
      file would be visible in the query unless otherwise restricted).

    - With both 'execute' and 'noexecute' permissions on an object type, the
      subject can decide whether or not to access a node object as the
      underlying object (say, a file object), or as the object type in
      question (say, a database node object).  This is done via ls__type (to
      be very specific about what type to open as), or via the open flags
      OBJ_O_EXEC / OBJ_O_NOEXEC.

    - If neither 'execute' nor 'noexecute' is granted for an object type,
      then the object cannot be opened as the type in question or as the
      underlying object type.

    - If 'execute' permission is granted but not 'noexecute', then the
      object cannot be opened as its underlying object type.  This can be
      used to prevent access to sensitive information in the underlying
      source code of the object, or to prevent access to data except through
      "official" means (e.g., accessing rows in a CSV file vs. accessing the
      actual textual content of the CSV file; or accessing a database vs.
      being able to see the connection information, possibly including
      passwords, in the underlying database connector file).

    - If 'noexecute' is granted but not 'execute', then the object cannot
      be opened as the type in question, but the underlying object can be
      opened.  For example, if execute is forbidden on 'shell' objects, then
      the user would be able to view the underlying shell object file that
      describes what command is to be executed, but the subject would not be
      able to open the object and cause the command to be run.  Similarly,
      if the object were a CSV file, the subject would be able to view the
      raw CSV file data, but not open the file and query its individual rows.


SECURITY TYPE DECLARATIONS

    Various data sources within Centrallix will need to declare the security
    type associated with the source's data.  For example, a database connector
    object may need to declare the security type of the database, its tables,
    and the rows within the various tables.  There could be one generic type
    for all rows, with the ability to specify an alternate type for rows in
    specific tables.  This same concept can apply to fields within tables as
    well.


APPLICATION-SPECIFIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION

    The security policy system permits the inclusion of (delegation to) other
    policy files beyond the main system security policy.  This mechanism allows
    finer grained control of per-application security without having to modify
    the main policy file for each application's needs.


SECURITY POLICY FILE

    The security policy file will be a structure file.  See the below file for
    a sample of how a policy file is constructed:

	SecurityModel_SamplePolicy.pol

    Below are the components of a policy:

    A.	Global Policy Settings "system/sec-policy"

	mode = {disable|warn|enforce} - This setting allows the system
	    administrator to completely disable the security subsystem, or
	    to leave it disabled with warning messages about where security
	    failures would occur.  This setting is only valid in the top level
	    (main) security policy.

	default = {allow|deny|none} - This setting, most commonly used in sub-
	    policies, controls what the default action is should no rules
	    match.  The 'none' option is only valid in sub-policies.

	domain = "string" - Declares the name of the domain, which shows up
	    as the first part of object specs and endorsement specs.  This
	    defaults to "system" on the top level policy.  The domain is
	    allowed to be the same as that of the parent policy only if the
	    delegation rules in the parent policy permit it.  Otherwise the
	    domain must be unique system-wide.  Policies encountered with
	    duplicate domains will be rejected.

	domain_path = "string" - This declares the domain's path in the
	    ObjectSystem, that this policy applies to.  Defaults to "/" on the
	    top level policy, and to the directory containing the .pol file
	    for sub-policies.


    B.	Subject Definitions "system/sec-policy-subject"

	authentication_method = {static|unix|altpasswd|...} - defines the
	    method of identification and authentication that are allowed for
	    this subject list.  This is a comma-separated list of values.

	required_authentications = Number - the number of authentication 
	    methods required in order for authentication to succeed.  This is
	    used for two-factor authentication.

	identity = "string" - this provides the identity (user name), and is
	    required for the 'static' method.

	password = "string" - for the 'static' authentication method, this
	    provides the password hash, in the same format used in /etc/shadow
	    files.  If this is left unset, then no password is required.

	key = "string" - an RSA public key, in PEM format, that the subject
	    can use to identify itself.  This is only really useful when the
	    subject list only contains a single subject, and is typically used
	    when codesigning to prove authorship.

	use_as_default = {no|yes} - whether this subject is used as the default
	    subject should the user not yet be logged in.  This is used to
	    provide anonymous access to the system.  Defaults to 'no'.

	criteria = {expression} - allows for the restriction of this subject
	    list to only a subset of the subjects that the source (unix,
	    altpasswd, etc.) can provide.  

	add_endorsement = "string" - adds the given endorsement to the user's
	    session when this subject list is used to identify and authenticate
	    the user.


SIGNING KEY CONFIGURATION

    A security policy file may define what signing keys are used to identify
    an object as having been authored by a specific identity.  The public key
    of an RSA key pair will be included in or referenced by the policy file
    in a subjectkey directive.


AUTHENTICATION MAPPING AND TOKEN STORAGE

    The security subsystem will often need to map identities between the
    Centrallix server and local or remote data sources, and authentication
    tokens may need to be stored to permit access to those remote sources.
    Furthermore, sometimes a user may need to connect to a remote source
    as a different identity, and that information can be stored as well.

    The basic premise of the key repository is that the stored auth tokens
    (passwords, cookies, oauth1/2 tokens, etc.) will be encrypted with the
    user's login password (or other persistent authentication token) as the
    primary key dependency.  If the user's login password changes, then the
    system will need to prompt the user for their old password in order to
    update the key repository.

    The token storage subsystem will have the following aspects:

    A.	User Token (password) -- this is supplied by the user when the user
	logs in.  Since it may be possible for a user to have more than one
	valid token, there could be multiple entries here for the user,
	with the User Private Key made available via each of them.

    B.	User Salt -- this is a random plaintext value generated when the
	user logs in the first time, and is used by the KDF (see User Key).

    C.	User Key -- when the user logs in, the password (User Token) and the
	User Salt are processed through a Key Derivation Function (KDF), with
	a configurable number of rounds, to produce a 256-bit User Key.  The
	User Key is never stored, but is kept in memory while the user has an
	active session (login) going, since the KDF is intentionally an
	expensive operation.

    D.	User Public Key and Private Key -- the first time the user connects
	to the system, an RSA public/private key pair is generated for the
	user's token storage.  This is different than public/private keys
	used for proof of authorship.  Public key cryptography is used here
	so that cryptographic tokens can be provided to a user without
	having to know the user's User Token or User Key in advance.  The
	User Public Key is stored in plaintext, and the User Private Key is
	encrypted with the User Key and stored encrypted.

    E.	Resource Data -- this is identification and authentication data that
	the user needs in order to connect to a service outside of Centrallix,
	for example a database server or email server or web service.  The
	Resource Data is stored along with a Resource Data Salt, and is stored
	encrypted with the User Public Key.

    The schema for this data storage will have three main entities:

    A.	User Data:
	1.  User identity (e.g., username or email)
	2.  User Public Key, unencrypted
	3.  Date Record Created

    B.	User Authentications:
	1.  User identity
	2.  Authentication class ("password", "oauth2", etc.)
	3.  User Salt
	4.  User Private Key, encrypted with User Key
	5.  Removal Flag
	6.  Date Record Created

    C.	User Resources:
	1.  User identity
	2.  Resource ID (a string)
	3.  Resource Data Salt
	4.  Resource Data, encrypted with User Private Key and the Resource
	    Data Salt.
	5.  Date Record Created

    The process for looking up the correct row in User Authentications may
    involve one or more tries, since it is not known in advance which record
    the current User Token applies to.  In order to verify that a record is
    correct, the User Key is generated, used to decrypt the User Private Key,
    and then the User Private Key is verified against the User Public Key to
    ensure a match.  If there is a match, then the correct record has been
    found, otherwise the system must continue to check records for the given
    user identity.

    If a user changes their user token (password), then this database will
    need to be updated.  If a mechanism is provided to change a password
    through Centrallix, or where Centrallix is notified (e.g., via PAM) of
    the change, this process can take place automatically.  Otherwise, the
    user may need to be prompted for their old token (password) in order
    to regain access to the User Private Key.  Then, a new User Auth record
    is created based on the new User Key, and the previous User Auth record
    is removed or is marked for removal, to ensure User Private Key recovery
    in the event of an unauthorized password change.


OSML HOOKS (COVERAGE ENFORCEMENT)

    In order to implement, and prevent the bypassing of, the security policy,
    there needs to be a complete set of hooks in the OSML to call into the 
    security reference monitor for authorization.  These hooks are described
    below:

	objOpen:

	    An object may be opened, with a given mode (r, w, or rw), if the
	    corresponding access types (read, write, or read and write) are
	    allowed for the object.  The OSML should check these two access
	    types based on the mode.  In the event of an invalid mode (03),
	    the open must fail.

	obj_internal_ProcessOpen:

	    This internal processing function handles the chaining of drivers
	    based on object types and so forth.  This function will need to
	    check for exec and noexec permissions when deciding whether to
	    chain drivers or handle the open-as logic.  If a driver would be
	    chained, but open-as would cause it not to be, then noexec
	    permission is required; if noexec is not available, then the open
	    must fail.  If a driver would be chained, and open-as is not
	    instructing otherwise, then exec permission is required; if exec
	    permission is not available in that case, then the driver is simply
	    not chained, as opposed to returning a failure.  If neither exec
	    nor noexec is available in a situation where a driver would
	    normally be chained, then the open must fail.  To summarize:

		would-chain + open-as + !noexec:	FAIL
		would-chain + open-as + noexec:		SUCCEED
		would-chain + !exec + noexec:		SUCCEED, NO CHAIN
		would-chain + !exec + !noexec:		FAIL
		would-chain + exec:			SUCCEED

	    Of course, if chaining is prevented, and the end of the path has
	    not been reached, then the open will fail nonetheless, but not
	    with a security error but with a no driver to handle the path
	    type of error.

	driver xxxOpen():

	    Since the Open operation, with OBJ_O_CREAT set, can create a new
	    object, each driver instance must check for create permission
	    before acting on the OBJ_O_CREAT flag.

	objClose:

	    No checks need to be made, unless an automatic commit occurs, in
	    which case write permission is required.

	objCreate:
	
	    The hook should check for both create permissions for the given
	    object type and path.  The hook will need to determine the object
	    type before allowing the create operation to proceed, which may
	    require additional OSML functionality.

	objDelete, objDeleteObj:

	    These functions should check for delete permissions for the given
	    object type and path.

	objInfo, objPresentationHints, objRead, objGetAttrType,
	objGetAttrValue, objGetFirstAttr, objGetNextAttr, objGetFirstMethod,
	objGetNextMethod, objOpenAttr:

	    These functions should check for read permissions for the given
	    object type and path.  objGetAttrType and objGetAttrValue are
	    allowed to return the "name", "inner_type", and "outer_type"
	    attributes if read OR observe permissions are available.

	objSetAttrValue, objExecuteMethod, objWrite, objAddAttr,
	objAddVirtualAttr:

	    These functions should check for write permissions for the given
	    object type and path.

	objOpenQuery, objQueryClose:

	    These function need no security checks.  Checks are performed when
	    objects are actually fetched.

	objQueryFetch:

	    This function must check for observe permissions on any object to
	    be returned.  If no objects remain that are observable, the
	    function must return NULL.

	objQueryDelete:

	    This function must check for delete permissions on any subobject to
	    be deleted.

	objQueryCreate:

	    This function must check for create permissions on the subobject to
	    be created.

	objMultiQuery, objGetQueryCoverageMask, objGetQueryIdentityPath:

	    These functions need no security checks, since the security checks
	    are handled at a lower level as the SQL engine calls back into the
	    OSML to perform its operations.


CODE SIGNING

    In order to provide strong assurance of authorship, code signing will be
    available.

    A.	Code Signing Format

	The format to be used for code signing will be a PEM digital signature
	appended to the end of the object in question (an app, cmp, rpt, pol,
	etc., file).  The signature will be generated based on the entire
	object content leading up to the beginning of the PEM block, including
	the newline character right before the PEM block.  As such, code that
	lacks a trailing newline will need such a newline added as a part of
	the signing process.  Developers should be aware of this quirk if using
	an editor which does not automatically ensure a trailing newline.

    B.	Code Signing Utility

	A basic code signing utility will be provided, but GPG may be used if
	the leading "begin pgp signed message", "hash:", and blank line are
	removed, or if an armored detached signature is created and appended
	to the file (assuming the file contained a trailing newline).  The code
	signing tool will 1) remove any existing digital signature from the
	file, 2) ensure the file has a trailing newline, 3) call gpg to
	generate a detached signature, and 4) append the signature to the end
	of the file.

    C.	Verification of Authorship

	The OSML will provide a system attribute, cx__author, which returns a
	string value containing the author's subject name (such as "u:root" or
	whatnot).

    D.	Digital Signature Verification
