nuances of how centrallix handles javascript.

 See javascript.txt for more information on how the javascript side of
 things work.


    -- Note about Unique Endings --

     You'll see the following notation:

             startup_*, build_wgtr_*, expinit_*, *Render, etc

     Where * represents some unique set of letters/numbers. (explanation
     given below)




= Server-side App handling =

 Once the server Identifies that the requested URI is an app, there
 are three important steps that happen:

    1) Conversion of App file to internal machine data

           wgtrParseOpenObject traverses the app file by using the
           OSML and converts the widget information into an internal
           machine data (WgtrNode struct).

    2) Auto Positioning

           the WgtrNode instance will then end up in the **Apos
           unit**. (read below)

    3) HTML generation

           The WgtrNode instance gets passed to **htrRender** which
           generates the HTML. (NOTE: instead of directly returning
           HTML pages or using PHP, perl, or other language to
           generate pages, Centrallix generates every web page in C).



== Conversion to Internal Machine Data ==



== Apos Unit (Auto Positioning) ==

seriously, can someone please fill in this information :), including
the reasoning behind _why_ it's even there (for simplicity for
non-techy users)


== HTML generation ==

Seeing the source code of a returned web page while reading this will
be extremely helpful. There's actually an example webpage that the
server returns called 'output_for_default_index.app.html'.


=== Logical Division of html page ===

 The returned web page is logically divided into different parts:

    * <script> includes (added on server-side via htrAddScriptInclude)

    * CSS information (added via htrAddStylesheetItem)

    * The actual HTML (added via htrAddBodyItem)

    * The initial javascript function where client-side control starts
      (body's onload attribute is startup_* (see "Unique Endings"
      section)) (added via htrAddScriptInit)

    * the JSON-like description of the widget tree being returned and
      the dynamically generated invocation of the js function
      wgtrSetupTree which traverses that JSON information and uses it
      to initialize all the DOM elements so that the DOM elements have
      the necessary js functions/members. (added via htrBuildClientWgtr)

 There are other parts as well, but the important thing here to note
 is that for every logical part (except the client widget tree
 (JSON-like description)), there is a corresponding htrAdd* function.

 For each page generation, there is a HtPage instance which has
 members for each logical part.


=== Flow of server-side html generation ===

 First, the server-side code traverses the WgtrNode instance.

 For each widget, it runs the corresponding *Render function (found in
 htmlgen/htdrv_*.c where * is the widget shorthand) which individually
 adds (to the HtPage instance) the needed information for each part
 for that particular widget. Thus, there are no html pages on the
 server, but just a bunch of *Render functions which have hardcoded in
 them what information to add.

 Also, because of the async-hack (see javascript.txt), every HTML
 request will run through the same algorithm which always generates an
 entire web-page, including global variables, even though that is not
 necessary.


= Misc information =

== Server-side "Classes" ==

 Centrallix has future support for what are called "classes". These
 "clases" are really just different data formats the client can
 request data to be sent as. There is a file where different 'classes'
 can be defined (centrallix/etc/useragent.cfg)

 First of all, the functionality for returning widget-tree data in
 different formats is not even currently (2008-07-11)
 implemented. Second, if it ever does get implemented, some portions
 of code will have to be moved (marked in htrRender() as '$$$ MARK:
 server-side classes $$$').
