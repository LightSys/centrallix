I   INTRODUCTION

    A DHTML Widget Driver (or, just "widget driver") provides the functionality
    needed to generate DHTML code (HTML and JavaScript) to make a widget 
    smoothly operate in a browser.  Widget drivers are probably the simplest
    extension component in Centrallix to author, but this document seeks to 
    shed some light on the otherwise obscure widget interactions and on the 
    HTML generation subsystem interface.

    Widgets in Centrallix come in two basic forms: visual widgets and nonvisual
    widgets.  Visual widgets usually represent some sort of control: a button,
    a single-line edit box, and the like.  Nonvisual widgets normally represent
    some kind of functionality, such as form widgets, event-action connector
    widgets, and JavaScript custom function widgets.

    Most visual widgets are built using DHTML layers, represented as absolute-
    positioned CSS style sheets.

    Next, we'll take a look at the seven basic subsections that Centrallix uses
    to build a DHTML application.


II  CENTRALLIX DHTML PAGE MODEL

    HTML applications have the advantage of being extremely easy to deploy.
    However, maintaining a set of DHTML applications can be a nightmare due
    to the way a HTML page is put together.  Centrallix addresses this problem
    by abstracting the layout of the DHTML page a little bit in order to make
    writing and using DHTML widgets a much easier task.

    Centrallix divides the DHTML page into seven basic subsections, which will
    be discussed in the following parts of this document.

    A.	Page Header

	The page header consists of all HTML code which resides between the
	<HEAD> and </HEAD> tags in the page.  This includes META tags, the
	page title, as well as style sheet (layer) declarations.

    B.	Variable Declarations

	The next section, within a <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript> block, defines
	global variables for the page.  These usually take the form of control
	variables for some of the widgets as well as (typically) one global 
	variable each for the instances of each widget, so that the widget can
	be referenced by its name on the page.  Variable declarations consist
	of a variable name and a default initialization value.

    C.	Script Functions

	Each widget driver uses a set of page-independent script functions
	to "power" the instances of the widget type it manages.  These script
	functions will probably at some point be moved out of the widget driver
	C code and into a separately-loadable (and thus cachable) set of .js
	files, but for now they are generated directly into the DHTML page.

	The connector nonvisual widget also generates page-dependent script
	functions in this category.

    D.	Event Handlers

	Most widget drivers install one or more event handlers.  These event
	handlers, for those who are familiar with the way DHTML event handling
	is performed, operate entirely at the top-level "document" and do not
	rely on the browser's idea of a "trickle-down" or "trickle-up" event
	processing model.  The event handlers are snippets of javascript code
	(not complete functions) which are grouped together when the final
	page is generated (i.e., all of the "mousemove" event handlers are put
	into a single javascript function).

	Widget driver code in the event handlers will have to be able to in
	some way "recognize" if the event occured on a widget that the driver
	manages.  This is normally done by "tagging" the widget's layers with
	a "kind" attribute containing a short string identifying the type of
	widget (e.g., "eb" for the editbox widget, "tb" for the text button
	widget, etc.)

    E.	Initialization

	The initialization code is very app-dependent, and is called as soon
	as the page finishes loading (the BODY tag onload event).  Typically,
	each widget driver will have installed a script function (see 'C', 
	above), which initializes an instance of a widget.  That initialization
	function is normally called, once per widget, from the initialization
	section of the page.

    F.	HTML Body Parameters

	The HTML <BODY> tag has some special parameters which need to be
	accessed by the widget drivers, and in particular by the 'page' widget
	driver.  These parameters, for instance, set page colors and background
	images.

    G.	HTML Body

	The HTML body contains the content of the page.  Typically, the layers
	which were declared in the page header (section A) are nested together
	and fleshed out with content in the HTML body via the use of properly
	nested <DIV> tags.


III PAGE GENERATION PROCESS

    The process by which the HTML generation subsystem as a whole generates a
    page is composed of two steps.  First, the widget drivers are activated in 
    a hierarchical fashion to generate each widget instance into the HTML page 
    data structures maintained by the subsystem.  These data structures reflect
    the seven various components of the page as described in the previous 
    section.

    Second, the HTML generation subsystem converts these data structures into
    the HTML page itself.

    The first step (involving the widget drivers) begins with the subsystem
    opening the top-level object in the page (either a "widget/page" type 
    object or a "widget/frameset" type object), looking up the correct driver
    to handle that type of widget, and then calling that widget's Render()
    function using that open object (which is a pObject, returned from the
    objOpen() OSML API method).

    The responsibility of the page widget driver (and, any other widget driver
    for that matter) is to perform a number of things when its Render()
    function is called.

	1.  Use the OSML objGetAttrValue/objGetAttrType calls to obtain the
	    necessary configuration data about the widget instance (such as 
	    x and y locations, background colors, etc).  Information regarding
	    these OSML API methods is provided later in this document.
	2.  Generate any needed variables, functions, event handlers, header
	    text, initialization code, and html body parameters.
	3.  Generate most of the html body, up to the point where a <DIV>
	    has been begun that represents the layer that will contain any
	    subwidgets.
	4.  Tell the HTML generation system to generate all subwidgets, if this
	    widget can contain subwidgets (some, such as an editbox or
	    checkbox, cannot).
	5.  Finish the containing layer from (3) above as well as any other
	    layers that have not been finished yet.


IV  HTML GENERATOR INTERFACE

    This section of the HTML Widget Driver authoring guide defines the
    interface functionality with the HTML generating subsystem.  Widget drivers
    use these routines to actually build the page and its widgets.

    Modules should #include the following files: "ht_render.h", "obj.h",
    "mtask.h", "mtsession.h".

    A.	Initialization

	Module initialization is performed in the xxxInitialize() function for
	the module, where 'xxx' is the module's chosen prefix.  Most widget
	drivers have prefixes of the form 'htxx' where 'xx' is a two-to-four
	letter abbreviation of the module, such as 'eb' for the editbox 
	widget.

	The initialization process mainly consists of 1) allocating a new
	driver structure, 2) filling out the appropriate fields in the
	structure, 3) adding events and/or actions to the driver structure,
	4) initializing any module globals, and finally, 5) registering the
	driver structure with the HTML generation subsystem.  The module's
	Initialize() function should return 0 on success.

	Function: htrAllocDriver() returns pHtDriver

	    This function allocates a new initialized HtDriver structure.  
	    After calling this function and obtaining the HtDriver pointer,
	    the module's Initialize() routine should set up the structure
	    appropriately and then register it with the next function below.

	Function: htrRegisterDriver(pHtDriver drv) returns int

	    This function registers a new widget driver with the DHTML 
	    generation subsystem.  On success, it returns 0; on failure it
	    returns -1.

	Function: htrAddAction(pHtDriver drv, char* action_name) returns int

	    Adds an Action to the catalog of actions associated with this 
	    widget driver.

	Function: htrAddEvent(pHtDriver drv, char* event_name) returns int

	    Adds an Event to the catalog of events associated with this widget
	    driver.

	Function: htrAddParam(pHtDriver drv, char* eventaction,
			char* param_name, int datatype) returns int

	    Adds a parameter (with a given data type) to an event or action.

	Structure: HtDriver (pHtDriver is the pointer typedef)

	    Name	char[64]	A descriptive name of the driver.

	    WidgetName	char[64]	A one-word name of the widget.  This
					name will be used in the structure file
					type name when declaring an instance of
					the widget, as in "widget/widgetname"
					where "widgetname" is this property.

	    Render	function ptr.	The module's Initialize() function
					should set this function pointer to
					the module's Render() function.  See
					below for more information on Render().

	    Verify	function ptr.	This function pointer should be set to
					the module's Verify() function, which
					is not yet used.  Verify() should
					simply return 0.

	    All other elements of this structure are "private" and should not
	    be modified or accessed directly by the widget driver.  Instead,
	    there are API functions which are used to set up these values.  If
	    you look at the already-implemented drivers in the Centrallix
	    distribution, many of them *do* access these directly, but only
	    because the additional API functions were not written at that time.
	    The additional API functions make the initialization process
	    considerably simpler, so please do use them :)


    B.  Callback Methods

	During initialization, the module specified two callback methods which
	the HTML generation subsystem will use to create widgets within the
	page.  Note that these functions are provided by the widget driver
	itself, not by the HTML generation subsystem in general.

	The first method, Verify(), does nothing at current.  These Verify()
	methods should simply return 0 (success) when called.

	    int htxxVerify();

	The second method, Render(), actually generates an instance of a widget
	into the page.  It should return 0 (success) upon successfully 
	generating the widget, or -1 (failure) if something goes wrong in the
	process (such as missing configuration data).

	    int htxxRender(pHtSession s, pObject w_obj, int z,
			    char* parentname, char* parentobj);

	The 's' parameter is the generator subsystem session structure, which
	provides the context for the generation of the page.  Almost all of the
	API functions require the session structure to be passed as a
	parameter.

	The 'w_obj' parameter is an open OSML object, either obtained with the
	objOpen() call or with objQueryFetch().  The object should be treated
	as a readonly object.

	The 'z' parameter is the current Z-buffer level for the generated
	page.  The widget driver should use this Z value as a 'base value' for
	its generated layers and objects, and pass a Z value one higher than
	the highest it used, when calling htrRenderSubwidgets() or similar.

	The 'parentname' parameter is the name of the "document" type object
	that will be containing the widget.

	The 'parentobj' parameter is the name of the "layer" object that will
	contain the widget.  Normally this is related to the above parameter,
	such as a 'parentname' of 'thing.document' would correspond to a
	'parentobj' of 'thing'.


    C.	Page Generation API Methods

	The following list of functions are used by widget drivers to actually
	generate the DHTML and scripting needed to support widget instances.

	htrAddStylesheetItem(pHtSession s, char* html_text) returns int

	    This functions adds a stylesheet definition to the header between
	    the tags <STYLE TYPE="text/css"></STYLE>.  It is recommended to
	    maintain a consistant indention style (using a tab '\t' character)
	    at the beginning of these lines.

	    Example:

		htrAddStylesheetItem(s, "\t#pgtop { POSITION:absolute; VISIBILITY:hidden;");

	htrAddHeaderItem(pHtSession s, char* html_text) returns int

	    This function adds text directly to the HTML header section of the
	    generated document (between <HEAD> and </HEAD>).  The html_text
	    string's content is copied into subsystem data structures.

	    It is generally recommended to maintain a reasonably consistent
	    indenting method when generating the HTML.  See some of the 
	    existing widget drivers for examples of this.

	    The 'pHtSession' parameter 's' is passed to the Render() function
	    as the first parameter.

	    Example:

		htrAddHeaderItem(s, "    <TITLE>This is a title</TITLE>\n");

	htrAddBodyItem(pHtSession s, char* html_text) returns int

	    This function adds text directly into the HTML body of the 
	    document, and works in a manner identical to the above HeaderItem
	    function.

	    Example:

		htrAddBodyItem(s, "<DIV id=lb0base>Label:</DIV>\n");

	htrAddBodyParam(pHtSession s, char* html_param) returns int

	    This function adds a 'parameter' to the HTML <BODY> tag of the
	    document.

	    Example:

		htrAddBodyParam(s, "bgcolor=white");

	htrAddScriptGlobal(pHtSession s, char* var_name, char* initialization,
		    int flags) returns int

	    This function adds a global script variable to the page.  The 
	    'var_name' parameter contains the name of the variable, and the
	    'initialization' parameter contains its default value in the 
	    variable declaration.

	    The 'flags' parameter tells the rendering subsystem whether it
	    should auto-free the pointed-to value of either or both of the
	    'var_name' and 'initialization'.  It can contain one or more of
	    the following values ORed together:

		HTR_F_NAMEALLOC	    -	auto-free the var_name when complete.
		HTR_F_VALUEALLOC    -	auto-free 'initialization' when done.

	    Example:

		ptr = nmMalloc(strlen(name)+1);
		if (!ptr) return -1;
		strcpy(ptr,name);
		htrAddScriptGlobal(s, ptr, "null", HTR_F_NAMEALLOC);

	htrAddScriptFunction(pHtSession s, char* fn_name, char* fn_text,
		    int flags) returns int

	    This function adds a unique function to the document.  Usually, the
	    function consists of constant text, and so the 'flags' argument is
	    normally left as zero.  However, if the driver allocates a block of
	    memory for the function text or name, it can request that the HTML
	    generation subsystem free the string's memory when the document has
	    been completely sent to the client.  Drivers can do this by using
	    one or more of the following 'flags':

		HTR_F_NAMEALLOC	    -	auto-free fn_name.
		HTR_F_VALUEALLOC    -	auto-free fn_text.

	    Example:

		htrAddScriptFunction(s, "lb_hide", "\n"
		    "function lb_hide()\n"
		    "    {\n"
		    "    this.visibility = 'hidden';\n"
		    "    return true;\n"
		    "    }\n", 0);

	htrAddScriptInit(pHtSession s, char* init_text) returns int

	    This function adds script code to the main initialization function
	    for the whole HTML page.  This function works just like the 
	    AddHeaderItem and AddBodyItem functions - the init_text is copied
	    into subsystem data structures and thus its memory can be freed or
	    re-used immediately after the function call (unlike the AddScript-
	    Function and AddScriptGlobal functions).

	    The init_text should begin with four spaces and end with a line-
	    feed character (\n), to match the generated HTML style.

	    The initialization code will be executed after the entire page has
	    been loaded into the browser but before any event triggering is 
	    enabled.

	    It is normally expected that a widget will initialize itself before
	    any subwidgets, so this function should be called when necessary
	    *before* any subwidgets are generated.

	    Example:

		htrAddScriptInit(s, "    lb_init(document.layers.lb0base);\n");

	htrAddEventHandler(pHtSession s, char* event_src, char* event, 
		    char* drvname, char* handler_code) returns int

	    This function adds an event handler script segment (not a complete
	    function declaration).  The event handler will manage an event of
	    a given type, for a given type of widget.

	    The 'event_src' parameter is always "document" for the time being.

	    The 'event' parameter is the type of event.  Allowed types are
	    events such as "MOUSEMOVE", "MOUSEOVER", "MOUSEOUT", "MOUSEDOWN",
	    "MOUSEUP", "KEYPRESS", and so forth.

	    The 'drvname' parameter is the two-to-four letter abbreviation of
	    the widget driver, such as 'eb' for the 'editbox' widget.  This
	    parameter is used by the subsystem to keep event scripts for the 
	    different widgets distinct from one another.

	    Finally, the 'handler_code' parameter is the text of the script
	    segment.

	    All of the string values here are *copied* by the subsystem into
	    internal session structures.

	    IMPORTANT NOTE:  Calling this function twice for the same event and
	    the same widget driver will not have the expected result.  Because
	    the script segments are keyed internally by driver, event source,
	    and event type, such subsequent calls will be completely ignored
	    by the HTML generation subsystem.  Widget drivers should group all
	    code for a given event type together in one call to this function.

	    Example:

		htrAddEventHandler(s, "document", "MOUSEOVER", "lb",
		    "    if (e.target && e.target.kind == 'lb')\n"
		    "        {\n"
		    "        e.target.bgcolor = '#ff0000';\n"
		    "        }\n" );

	htrDisableBody(pHtSession s) returns int

	    This function is used to disable the output of the <BODY> and
	    </BODY> tags, including any body parameters added with the API
	    function htrAddBodyParam().  This is primarly used by the frameset
	    widget driver to suppress the output of the body in favor of the
	    frameset declarations.  Note that it probably does not make sense
	    to call htrRenderSubwidgets() when the body has been disabled :)

	htrRenderWidget(pHtSession s, pObject widget_obj, int z, 
		    char* parentname, char* parentobj) returns int

	    This function is used to render a subwidget within the current
	    widget.  In order to use this function, the calling driver most
	    likely will have done an objOpenQuery() operation, fetching any
	    subwidgets with objQueryFetch(), and then proceeding to call this
	    function with the pObject returned from the fetch operation.  Note
	    that this function does *not* close the open widget object; if the
	    widget driver opens an object with objOpen or objQueryFetch, it 
	    must also close that object with objClose.

	    Parameter 's' is the session parameter.

	    The 'widget_obj' parameter is a pObject handle returned most likely
	    from objQueryFetch.

	    The 'z' parameter is the z-index that the subwidget should start to
	    be generated at.  It should be one higher than the highest z index
	    used by the current widget.

	    The 'parentname' parameter is the name of the document object into
	    which the subwidget will be rendered.  This is needed so that the
	    subwidget can reference its CSS layers / DIV sections correctly.

	    The 'parentobj' parameter is normally the name of the layer (or 
	    window) which contains the above mentioned document object.

	htrRenderSubwidgets(pHtSession s, pObject widget_obj, char* docname,
		    char* layername, int z) returns int

	    This function automates the generation of subwidgets for those
	    widgets that are simple containers.  Instead of having to do an
	    objOpenQuery type of loop, in this case the calling driver just 
	    passes its own widget object (from its Render() function call) to
	    htrRenderSubwidgets(), and this function does all of the query
	    work.

	    See the htrRenderWidget() function for further details on the 
	    parameters (the widget_obj parameter is the primary difference).


V   FREQUENTLY-USED OSML METHODS

    This section details the OSML methods that are most frequently used by 
    widget drivers.  This isn't intended to be a complete OSML API reference.

    objGetAttrValue(pObject obj, char* attrname, pObjData value) returns int

	This function obtains the value of an attribute from the application
	definition file, probably a ".app" structure file.  The first function
	parameter, 'obj' is the open object, probably that from the Render()
	function parameter.

	The second parameter, 'attrname' is the (usually) case-sensitive name
	of the attribute whose value is being obtained.

	The third parameter is a pointer to a C union type.  This union is used
	to pass data of various types to and from some of the OSML API
	functions.  Basically, it allows the passed value to be one of several
	types:

	    - pointer to an integer,
	    - pointer to a char pointer or char array,
	    - pointer to a double-precision floating point value,
	    - pointer to a pointer to a DateTime structure,
	    - pointer to a pointer to a MoneyType structure.

	The POD(x) macro is generally used to do the appropriate typecasting,
	to avoid needless declarations of pObjData variables.  The POD(x)
	macro is defined as:  ((pObjData)(x))

	This API function returns -1 if the attribute was not found, or on
	other types of errors.  It returns 1 if the attribute was found but was
	NULL.  It returns 0 if the attribute was found and its value was 
	successfully returned.

	Examples:

	    int x;
	    char* strval;
	    if (objGetAttrValue(w_obj, "x", POD(&x)) != 0) x=0;
	    if (objGetAttrValue(w_obj, "style", POD(&strval)) != 0) strval="";

    objGetAttrType(pObject obj, char* attrname) returns int

	This function returns the data type of a given attribute.  See the 
	objGetAttrValue() function reference for information about the two
	parameters involved.

	This function returns an integer, which will be -1 if the attribute
	was not found, or one of the following values, defined in the file
	"datatypes.h":

	    DATA_T_INTEGER:	an integer value
	    DATA_T_STRING:	a char* string value
	    DATA_T_DOUBLE:	a double-precision floating point value
	    DATA_T_MONEY:	a 48-bit money representation
	    DATA_T_DATETIME:	a date/time structure

	There are a few other possibilities, but none should be relevant to
	the driver author at this time.

	Example:

	    if (objGetAttrType(w_obj, "x") != DATA_T_INTEGER)
		{
		mssError(0,"HTLB","Labels need an integer 'x' property");
		return -1;
		}

    objOpenQuery(pObject obj, char* where, char* orderby, void* tree, 
		void** orderby_exp) returns pObjQuery

	This function is used to issue a query request for subobjects of a 
	given parent object, which makes it just perfect for discovering 
	subwidgets declared within a given widget.

	The 'obj' parameter is the pObject reference to the parent object.

	The 'where' parameter is a textual expression constraining what
	objects are returned, such as ":x == 1".  This parameter is normally
	left as the empty string "" by widget drivers.

	The 'orderby' parameter is used to change the sorting of the returned
	objects.  It is normally left NULL by widget drivers.

	The 'tree' and 'orderby_exp' parameters are normally left NULL by 
	widget drivers, but could contain an expression and an array of 
	expressions, respectively, that are precompiled selection constraints
	and sorting keys.  The expressions in question are expression trees
	of type 'pExpression'.

	The returned value can be NULL if an error occurred or if the parent
	object *cannot* contain subobjects.  Otherwise, a pObjQuery reference
	is returned.

	Example:

	    pObjQuery qy;
	    pObject subobj;
	    qy = objOpenQuery(w_obj, "", NULL, NULL, NULL);
	    if (qy)
		{
		while ((subobj = objQueryFetch(qy,O_RDONLY)))
		    {
		    /** do some stuff here with subobj **/

		    /** close the subobj **/
		    objClose(subobj);
		    }
		objQueryClose(qy);
		}

    objQueryClose(pObjQuery query) returns int

	This closes an open query.  It also cancels pending results, if need
	be, if the calling module did not fetch them all.  It returns 0 on
	success and -1 on failure (but, in all cases on failure the query will
	be closed if it indeed was open).

    objQueryFetch(pObjQuery query, int mode) returns pObject

	This function is used to obtain a subobject returned from an open
	query.  It opens the object with the given 'mode', which is normally
	O_RDONLY for widget driver queries.  The returned pObject can then be
	used in objGetAttrValue() calls and the like.

	This function returns an open object on success, or NULL if there are
	no more results available.

    objClose(pObject obj) returns int

	This function is used to close an open object.  All objects that a
	widget driver opens with objOpen() or objQueryFetch() must be closed
	using this function prior to the widget driver returning from its
	Render() function.

	This function returns 0 on success or -1 on an error, but in all cases
	if the object was open, it will be closed by the objClose() call.


VI  OTHER FREQUENTLY-USED UTILITY METHODS

    The following is a list of methods that widget drivers might frequently
    use, but which are not specific to the OSML nor to the HTML generation
    subsystem.

    A.	Memory Manager Methods

	Almost never use malloc() or free() in Centrallix code.  Instead, use 
	one of the below sets of routines.

	nmMalloc(int size)
	nmFree(void* ptr, int size)

	    These are centrallix-lib memory manager wrappers.  This pair of 
	    methods are normally used for allocating fixed blocks of data,
	    such as for "structs" and "unions".  The size of the block must be
	    known at nmFree() time.  These methods are not compatible with the
	    below nmSysMalloc() and nmSysFree().  It is not recommended to mix
	    these functions with malloc() and free(), although doing so will
	    not cause a program crash.  However, doing this could result in 
	    at the least inefficiency, and at the worst a serious memory leak.

	nmSysMalloc(int size)
	nmSysFree(void* ptr)
	nmSysStrdup(char* ptr)
	nmSysRealloc(void* ptr, int newsize)

	    These are more centrallix-lib memory manager functions that are
	    designed to work with memory allocations which require realloc-
	    type functionality or which work with blocks of data which are
	    not typically consistent in size.  The size of the block does not
	    need to be known at nmSysFree() time.  These methods are NOT 
	    COMPATIBLE WITH nmMalloc/nmFree NOR WITH malloc/free.  DO NOT MIX
	    THEM!!!!  (e.g., what you malloc() with one set of methods, free()
	    with the same set of methods).

	    In the HTML generation subsystem, the nmMalloc()/nmFree() methods
	    should be used in conjunction with the functions which take the
	    HTR_F_NAMEALLOC/HTR_F_VALUEALLOC routines.  Furthermore, the 
	    nmMalloc()d strings should be just long enough to contain the 
	    string and zero terminator, and no more.  Of course, strings need
	    not be allocated with nmMalloc() if they are constants, and in that
	    case the HTR_F_xxxALLOC flags shouldn't be supplied.


    B.	Session and Error Reporting Methods

	mssError(int reset, char* modname, char* fmt, ...)

	    This function is used for error reporting.  It adds an error to the
	    error stack for the current session.

	    Set 'reset' to 1 if the error is being "discovered" entirely by
	    this module.  Set it to 0 if the error is in response to an error
	    status being returned from another API function, such as NULL
	    being returned from nmMalloc() or -1 being returned by the
	    objGetAttrValue function.  Note that most modules don't add another
	    message to the error stack upon detecting a memory allocation 
	    failure, since the nmMalloc() routine would have already added a
	    generic 'memory allocation failed' message.

	    'modname' is an abbreviation for the module generating the error.
	    For the HTML widget drivers, this is normall of the form "HTxx"
	    where "xx" is the abbreviation of the module.

	    'fmt' is a format string that can contain '%d' and '%s' in order
	    to substitute integer and string values, respectively from the
	    variable argument list.


VII DEVELOPMENT BY PROTOTYPING

    Probably one of the easiest ways of developing a new widget for Centrallix
    is via prototyping the widget in a simple DHTML page, first outside of the
    Centrallix server.  The following section details a recommended approach to
    developing a new widget for Centrallix.

    A.	Designing your Widget

	The first step is normally to, either formally or informally, decide on
	a basic design for the widget.  One should consider some of the below
	issues when considering a design:

	    1.	What and how many layers should be used?  Enough layers should
		be used to make the widget function smoothly, but layer must be
		kept to a minimum, as they do use browser resources.  A widget
		that is absolutely positioned (via X and Y) MUST have at least
		one layer.  Nonvisual widgets typically do not have any layers.

	    2.	How will the widget look?  How will it interact with the user?

	    3.	What events (mouseup, mousedown, etc.) will need to be trapped?

	    4.	Will the widget receive mouse, keyboard, and/or data focus?  If
		keyboard focus, it should receive keyboard input.  Also, 
		whether the widget receives keyboard focus or not, will it use
		hotkeys?

	    5.	Can the widget contain other visual subwidgets?  Can it contain
		nonvisual subwidgets? (the latter is necessary if the widget is
		to have Events).

	    6.	Will the size of the widget's contents change over time?  If so
		and if the widget can contain visual subwidgets, then it may
		need to set some values to interact with the pg_resize()
		mechanism.

	Sometimes it can be helpful to draft the widget's design by simply
	creating a DHTML page outside of Centrallix that does some of what you
	need.  However, some widgets need the services of other Centrallix
	widgets in order to be functional.  In this case, the following process
	can be helpful.

    B.	Generating the First "Rough Draft"

	To get started, copy a simple widget to a new file.  Go to the htmlgen
	directory, and either make a copy of htdrv_pane for a visual widget, or
	perhaps htdrv_execmethod for a nonvisual widget.  These widgets can
	provide simple starting points.

	Edit the new file and do a file-wide search & replace on the module's
	prefix.  For the pane widget, for instance, replace all instances of
	"htpn" with your driver's prefix and "HTPN" with the upcase version of
	your driver's prefix.  Then, modify the Name and WidgetName strcpy()'s
	in the Initialize function to reflect your driver (see the section on
	Initialization for more information).

	It is usually best to remove all functions, event handlers, and global
	script variables from the driver to get started.  It is usually also
	best to remove all but one CSS layer and to remove all of the HTML
	BODY code as well.  To get started with a visual widget, create one
	starting layer (the base layer) with one layer, say named "xy0base"
	(the 0 comes from the idcnt, as each widget must be uniquely numbered).

	Change the pn_init() function call and definition appropriately to
	one to be used by your widget.  In this case, xy_init() would be
	appropriate.  Since pn_init() passes two layers in initialization,
	you may need to remove the reference to one of them since you are
	starting with just one layer  (in the pane widget, one layer is used
	as the container, and one outer layer to draw the 3-D border around 
	the container, by using an HTML table).

	Add the following code to the HTML body

	    "<DIV id=xy0base><!--Code It Here--></DIV>"

	so you can find the place to prototype your HTML code to design the 
	visual aspect of the widget.  Of course, the 0 should come from the 
	idcnt here as well, so that it matches that in the HTML header's CSS
	declarations.  And 'xy' should match the last part of the module's 
	prefix (minus the 'ht' part; in this case the module's Initialize
	function would be called 'htxyInitialize()').

	You will probably want to remove most of the objGetAttrValue() params 
	from the Render() function in the widget, except those needed to 
	position a visual layer on screen.

	Finally, delete all log entries from the CVS header in the file except
	the dollar-sign-Log-dollar-sign line, of course, and change the 
	author/date/etc. information in the file header.

	To get the widget added to the system, edit Makefile and add the new
	widget's .o file to the XHTDRIVERS= line.  Don't include the path to
	the driver; the makefile does that automatically.  Then, edit lsmain.c
	and add the widget's Initialize function to the startup code there 
	alongside the other calls to widget Initialize() functions.  Be sure to
	add it somewhere *after* the main htrInitialize() call.

	Rebuild the Centrallix binary, and build a testbed .app file in the OS
	directory which creates a new widget of the appropriate type, embedded
	in appropriate other widgets to ensure proper testing and such.  Be 
	sure to create only ONE new widget instance; otherwise the prototyping
	process can become more difficult.

	Run Centrallix and load the test application, and save it to a file
	in the objectsystem.  Be sure NOT to save it as a '.app' file, rather
	use a '.html' extension!!!  Then, copy the html file to a second
	working copy in the same directory.  Don't modify the original, rather
	only modify the working copy.  You'll see why....

    C.	Prototyping the widget

	Once you've generated the widget, edit the source to the working copy
	of the page.  Find the spot where the "Code It Here" HTML comment is,
	and use that to enter the basic HTML to code the widget.  Also, find
	the init function and where the layer is declared and add layers as
	needed.

	You can view the page at any time by pointing Netscape to the working
	copy of the .html file via the running Centrallix server.

	Once the widget is working well enough to be cemented into the system
	as a widget, do a "diff" between the working copy and the original
	rough draft copy of the .html pages.  This will tell you what you had
	to add to make the widget work.  Using those rough additions as a 
	starting point, make changes to the widget driver to handle those
	needed additions and changes.  Then, recompile Centrallix.

	Note that eventually it will be easier to simply make a minor change
	and recompile the server than to go through the prototyping process
	again.  But, during the initial development of a complex widget, this
	prototyping process can help a great deal.
