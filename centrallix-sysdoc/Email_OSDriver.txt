OBJECT TREE STRUCTURE...

    The object tree will consist of the SMTP node object, which contains the
    configuration including the email sending method, and a series of zero or
    more email messages that can be interpreted by the MIME driver.  The email
    SMTP driver will not have knowledge about the internal format of an email
    message.

NODE ATTRIBUTES...

    send_method	    Specifies how emails are to be sent.  This can be either
		    "smtp" for direct-to-MTA emails, or "sendmail" to use the
		    server's builtin email sending program (which could
		    actually also be postfix or qmail or whatnot).

    server	    The DNS name or IP address of the server to use when
		    sending via direct-to-MTA SMTP.

    port	    The TCP port to use on the remote server when sending via
		    direct-to-MTA SMTP.

    spool_dir	    The OSML spool directory that will be used for storing
		    messages that have not yet been sent.  This should be a
		    location that supports the storage of arbitrary files.

    log_dir	    The OSML directory in which to place log messages about
		    the success or failure of transmitting email messages.
		    This should be a location that supports the log attributes
		    listed below.

    log_date_attr   The attribute name in which to place the date that the log
		    message was created.

    log_msgid_attr  The attribute name in which to place the Message-ID of the
		    email message being referenced by the log message.

    log_info_attr   The attribute name in which to place the content of the
		    log message itself.

    ratelimit_time  The minimum number of seconds between each email sent.
		    This can be a floating-point value and so can be fractional
		    (such as 0.5 to send at most two emails per second).  This
		    defaults to 1 second (60 emails per minute).

    domlimit_time   The minimum number of seconds between each email sent to
		    recipients at a given domain name.  This defaults to 5
		    seconds (20 emails per minute).

    The following attributes are only used when sending directly via SMTP (as
    opposed to via issuing a sendmail command and using the OS's builtin MTA).

    expire_time	    The number of seconds that an email message and its status
		    information will be kept in the spool directory after the
		    email has either been sent or encountered a permanent
		    error (default 3 days).

    retry_time      The number of seconds to wait before attempting to send a
		    particular email again (default 15 minutes).

    queue_time	    The maximum time (in seconds) that the system will keep
		    retrying a temporarily failed email (default 5 days).

    handshake_time  The maximum number of seconds the system will wait for the
		    remote end to respond with various SMTP protocol messages
		    (default 3 minutes).

    conn_limit	    The maximum number of SMTP connections to have open at any
		    one given time.  This defaults to 1.  Note that this also
		    controls the number of SMTP worker threads that this driver
		    will spawn to handle SMTP connections.

    domconn_limit   The maximum number of SMTP connections to have open at any
		    one given time for a given domain.  This defaults to 1.


EMAIL MESSAGE ATTRIBUTES...

    These attributes will be present on email message objects; however, the
    attributes will not be visible unless the messages are opened in such a
    way that the MIME driver does not automatically "cascade" onto the open
    operation.

    These attributes will be stored in a structure file in the spool
    directory, using the same name as the .eml file but with a .struct file
    extension instead.  Both the .eml and .struct files will be removed
    after the expire_date has passed.

    Attributes marked with a plus (+) can be modified until is_ready is set
    to 1, at which point all attributes become read-only.

    Attributes marked with an asterisk (*) are only available when using
    direct SMTP (as opposed to sendmail).

    name	    A unique identifier for this email.  Likely will be the
		    same as the Message-ID, but with ".eml" appended to the
		    end, for clarity.

    message_id	    The Message-ID of the email message being created.

    env_from	  + The envelope From address of the email (return-path).

    env_to	  + The envelope recipient (or recipient list) of the email.

    status	    The status of the email: Draft, Pending, Sent, Error.  The
		    'Error' status indicates a permanent failure to send the
		    email.  If a TempFail (4xx) occurs while sending, then the
		    message will remain in the Pending status (and the
		    last_try_status attribute will be set to TempFail).

    is_ready	  + Either 0 (default) to indicate that the email is not
		    ready to be sent or set to 1 to indicate that the email is
		    ready for the SMTP driver to send.
    
    first_try_date  The date/time of the first attempt to send this email.

    try_until_date* The latest that the driver will attempt to send this
		    email.

    try_count	  * The number of times that the system has attempted to
		    transmit the message.

    expire_date	    The latest date/time that this driver will retain status
		    information about this email (after that, only the log
		    messages in log_dir will remain available).  This defaults
		    to 72 hours (3 days) after the email either permanently
		    failed or was successfully sent.

    last_try_date   The date/time of the most recent attempt to send this
		    email.

    last_try_status The status of the last attempt to send this email (None,
		    TempFail, Fail).

    last_try_msg    The message from the last attempt to send; this could be
		    the message the remote SMTP server provided in response
		    to the attempt to send this email.


EMAIL MESSAGE CONTENT...

    Each email message will contain content, which can contain arbitrary data
    but will be of type 'message/rfc822'.

    The idea here is for the MIME message objectsystem driver to take care of
    the content of the email.

    When a new email is created, the SMTP driver will provide some basic
    information to the MIME driver (by creating the template object content),
    including the following:

	Message-ID  (containing the message_id)
	User-Agent  (containing "Centrallix/0.9.1" or whatnot)
	Subject	    (blank)
	Date	    (current date)
	MIME-Version (containing "1.0")
