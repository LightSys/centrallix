I   INTRODUCTION
  
    This document is just a little documentation on basic javascript code &
    centrallix. This is just to give a newbie some hints and a little bit of
    direction. I'm still getting use to JavaScript and Centrallix myself...
    so if you see anything wrong, please correct it. And if you can think of
    anything that would be usefull or helpful in any way, please add it.


II  ABBREVIATIONS
    Each module will have different and specific abbreviations to it's own 
    module and needs.  Here is a list of some abbreviations to help get you 
    started. Once you start to dive into the code, you will start to recognize 
    what the letters stand for. One way to learn the abbreviations of a 
    specific module is to look at that module's init function in the js files 
    (sometimes the init function lists out common abbreviations to that module).
    This list is not all-inclusive, it's just to help get you started and get 
    you into the centrallix widget mind frame.  Also, not all modules use the 
    same abbreviations (sorry there are different developers and different needs
    working for each module).

III COMMON LAYER ATTRIBUTES

    In Netscape's implementation of Javascript, different objects are passed to
    the event handler in different ways.  The Event object in Javascript
    contains a property called "target" that is the target object that the
    current event was executed on.  For instance, if one were to do a MOUSEDOWN
    event on an image, Event.target (or more commonly referred to as e.target)
    would contain a reference to the Image object of that specific image.  
    However, if a MOUSEDOWN event is triggered on a layer, e.target will 
    contain a reference to the layer's document property (l.document).

    This is not what we want, because most properties and attributes for layers
    and objects are set on the base of that object.  It would not be good to
    stick all properties on l.document.  To solve this inconsistancy and to
    standardize the events a little bit, we have created three attributes that
    should be on all visible objects.

    layer       - A reference to the containing layer of the current object.
                  This is used to get access to all the attributes and the
                  base object that an event occured on.
    
    mainlayer   - A reference to the base layer for a widget.  This is used
                  so that we can reference a widget as a whole.  It is used
                  in the page area functions to know what layer to draw the 
                  black box around.
    
    kind        - This is a tag used in the event handlers to check if a 
                  specific event is targeted at a specific widget.  This is
                  explained in greater detail below.

    The two most common objects that you will be attaching these properties to
    are the Image and the Layer objects.  Below are examples of how to properly
    assign these attributes for each of these objects.

    Layer:
        l.document.layer = l;
        l.mainlayer = l;
        l.kind = "cb";

    Image:
        l.document.images[0].layer = l;
        l.document.images[0].mainlayer = l;
        l.document.images[0].kind = "cb";

    Notice the difference between the two.  In the Layer object, the ".layer"
    attribute is a child of the ".document" attribute.  However, on the Image,
    ".layer" is just part of the image.  In both of these cases, we are
    assuming that "l" is the base layer for the widget and are assigning that
    to ".mainlayer".

    NOTE:  Strictly speaking, on the image example above, the .mainlayer and
        .kind properties that are set on the Image are not necessary.  Since
        the .layer property points back to "l", the .mainlayer and .kind
        properties from "l" will be used under standard event handling.
        However, we still recommend setting them, as they can be useful in
        other circumstances other than event handling.

    The ".kind" attribute is used in a widget to check whether an event that
    has occurred belongs to that specific widget.  We have to do this because
    the event functions in Centrallix put all events of a certain kind together
    in one function.  For example, when you register some code with the
    MOUSEDOWN event (using htrAddEventHandler()), that chunk of code gets stuck
    into the function that handles all the MOUSEDOWN events including the
    MOUSEDOWN events for all other widgets.  Thus, a distinction must be made
    on which widget should get the event.  We will normally wrap all the event
    code inside a conditional that uses the ".kind" attribute.  Here is an
    example (note: the "ly" variable is explained in the next paragraph):

        if (ly.kind == "cb") 
            {
            ... do checkbox event code ...
            }

    All of these parameters come together in the "ly" variable.  Each event
    handler (MOUSEDOWN, MOUSEOVER, etc) has its own function that gets called
    whenever that particular event type occurs.  This function is defined at the
    page level (not for individual widgets).  At the very top of that
    function is a conditional that checks to see if the ".layer" attribute is
    set for that object.  If it is, then ly is set to "e.target.layer" If it is
    not set, then it falls back and sets it to "e.target".  (Remember, e is 
    a reference to the current Event object)

        if (e.target.layer != NULL)
            ly = e.target.layer;
        else
            ly = e.target;

    As you can see, ly is then what we will use to reference the layer that
    an object occurred on.  We standardized on this to remove the need to 
    do checks all over the place.  Now we can just use "ly".  Now that we have
    ly set, we can reference ly.mainlayer to get a reference to the top layer
    for the current widget.  We can also reference ly.kind to find out what
    kind of widget this is.  See how this can be handy?


IV  EVENTS

    A. List of Events
       Mouse Move
       Mouse Out (a.k.a. leave)
       Mouse Over (a.k.a. enter)
       Mouse Down
       Mouse Up
       Key Down
       Key Up


V   CENTRALLIX TOOLS

    A. xstring

       There is a good explanation about the XString module in the 
       OSDriver_Authoring.txt document in the centrallix-sysdoc directory 
       under CVS. This is very helpful for building argument lists in c code
       to create javascript function calls.
    


VI  DEBUGGING TIPS

    A. alert("You message goes here");
       The alert method pops up a dialog box to display the specified message.
       Remember that if you are using c to create javascript code that you
       have to escape the quotes:
       "    htrAddScript(s,alert(\"Your message goes here\");\n"
       Also... if while debugging you have a TON of pop up windows, you can
       select the topmost one (it should be mostly covered) and select okay.
       It should get rid almost all, if not all, of the pop up windows - this
       is better than trying to click okay on ALL of them. 
      

    B. javascript:
       In your browser when running javascript dhtml: you may receive a 
       message in the status bar that indicates you have a javascript error.
       In the url window type "javascript:" and hit enter. You will get
       another window that lists the javascript errors, the file and the line
       number.

    C. TreeView in DOMViewer mode (only for debugging properties and such)
