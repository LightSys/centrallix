## Synopsis
This document outlines the current coverage of UI tests and test result format.
Each test includes:
- The properties being tested
- Test descriptions, including conditions for pass/fail results
## Test Result Format
### Format Structure

```text
TEST [#] = [Test Name / Description]
    Test [specific check description] ... [PASS/FAIL]
    Test [specific check description] ... [PASS/FAIL]
([number passed]/[total number of checks]) [PASS/FAIL]

[Component] Test [PASS/FAIL]
```

### Example
```text
TEST 1 = Hover behavior test
  Test pointimage change ... PASS
  Test tristate change ... PASS
(2/2) PASS

TEST 2 = Click behavior test
  Test click event ... FAIL
(0/1) FAIL

Button Test FAIL
```

----------
