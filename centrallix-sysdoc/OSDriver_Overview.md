OVERVIEW...

    This document provides a summary of how an ObjectSystem driver works and 
    the role that it fills within Centrallix.  It does not seek to go into
    detail about the inner workings of an ObjectSystem driver, but rather views
    the driver as a unit, within its context in Centrallix, including its
    relationship to other Centrallix components.


THE OBJECTSYSTEM DRIVER...

    An objectsystem driver (OSD) is a module which allows the Centrallix system
    to access data of a specific type or data which is stored in a specific 
    manner.  In this way, it is similar in concept to a "filesystem driver" 
    within an operating system or perhaps in some ways even a database access 
    driver for ODBC or similar systems.

    The objectsystem drivers are important components of the data abstraction
    mechanism in Centrallix, managed by the OSML, or ObjectSystem Management 
    Layer.  Together, the drivers and OSML create the "objectsystem", which
    is a filesystem-like collection of objects and subobjects arranged in a
    tree-structured hierarchy, where each piece of data is fully accessible
    and queryable from a functional standpoint.


THE NODE OBJECT...

    The objectsystem, as mentioned, consists of a tree-structured hierarchy,
    which actually consists of many smaller hierarchies of related objects, or
    subtrees.  For example, a given database may consist of a set of tables,
    and those tables will consist of columns and rows.  The database, tables,
    columns, and rows all comprise a subtree which is managed by one specific
    driver - in this case a driver with intelligence about that particular
    type of database server.

    The driver may in reality manage a large number of such subtrees, each
    referring to a different database with different tables, columns, and rows
    within it.  The root objects of these subtrees (in this case, the database 
    objects themselves) are called "node objects".  The node object is the top,
    or beginning, of a subtree of objects that a given driver works with, and
    as such, plays the critical role of joining that subtree into the rest of
    the objectsystem, thus the term 'node'.

    However, unlike normal filesystems (where the 'mount point' is analogous
    to our 'node objects'), Centrallix automatically connects the subtrees 
    into the ObjectSystem based on object types.  For example, if Centrallix
    finds data of a "CSV" type in a local file, it will transform the CSV data
    into a node object and invoke the CSV objectsystem driver to handle a 
    subtree of columns and rows for the CSV data.  This happens wherever CSV 
    data occurs, whether in a file, email attachment, database BLOB, or other 
    similar type of location.  

    For example, consider this situation where CSV data occurs in the file
    "/DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv":

	/ (root node object)
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryOne
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileOne.txt
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileTwo.csv
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileThree.html
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryTwo
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryThree

    If Centrallix had no intelligence about CSV data's structure, in the same
    way it has no intelligence about TXT data's structure, then the above 
    diagram is how things would appear in the ObjectSystem.  However,
    Centrallix does have intelligence about CSV data, via the "datafile"
    objectsystem driver, and so "FileTwo.csv" becomes a node object, with the
    resulting tree looking something like this:

	/ (root node object)
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryOne
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileOne.txt
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileTwo.csv
	    |	    |	    |
	    |	    |	    +-- columns
	    |	    |	    |	    |
	    |	    |	    |	    +-- first_name
	    |	    |	    |	    |
	    |	    |	    |	    +-- last_name
	    |	    |	    |
	    |	    |	    +-- rows
	    |	    |	     	    |
	    |	    |	     	    +-- 0
	    |	    |	     	    |
	    |	    |	     	    +-- 1
	    |	    |	     	    |
	    |	    |	     	    +-- 2
	    |	    |
	    |	    +-- FileThree.html
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryTwo
	    |
	    +-- DirectoryThree

    So, in this case, "FileTwo.csv" serves in two very different roles:  first,
    as a file in the filesystem, and second, as a "table" of rows and columns.
    It marks the transition between the local filesystem OSD and the datafile
    OSD.

    Thus, the datafile OSD does not obtain its information about the CSV data
    directly from the local filesystem, but instead from the filesystem OSD.
    This allows the datafile OSD to process CSV data from almost any location,
    rather than only from the local filesystem.


DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRIVERS...

    ObjectSystem Drivers generally fall into one of several categories.  We'll
    take a look at them in this section.

    A.	External-Data Drivers

	The external-data driver is an OSD which obtains most or all of its 
	information from outside the ObjectSystem, but uses information in
	the ObjectSystem for configuration purposes.  An example of this is a
	driver that accesses an external database server - its node object in
	the ObjectSystem doesn't contain the actual database of course, but 
	rather just the information about how to contact the database.  The
	node may contain information about the remote server's IP address,
	TCP port, database name, and other similar types of configuration 
	information.  In this sense, the node *links* to the remote data,
	rather than being the data itself.

    B.	Content Drivers

	A content driver has intelligence about how to analyze, pick apart,
	and break down content into meaningful data or structure.  It often
	needs no additional external information to help it sort through the
	content.  An example of this is the CSV datafile driver, which takes
	CSV content and breaks it down into its individual columns and rows.

    C.	Translation Drivers

	A translation driver takes existing content or structure and 
	transforms it into a different kind of content or structure that is
	useful in a different way than the original data.  Often, the original
	data is highly structured but the resulting content or data is in more
	of a summary form or a 'product' of sorts.  One example is the report
	writer driver, which can take information from all over the 
	objectsystem and condense it down into a single piece of content which
	summarizes that data in a meaningful way.  Another example is the 
	querytree OSD, which builds a new tree structure from data it obtains
	from various locations in the objectsystem.

    D.	Special-purpose Drivers

	Some OSD's are used for special purposes, usually internal to the OSML
	itself.  One example of this is the "rootnode" OSD, which is used to 
	configure the root of the objectsystem.  It normally is set to use a
	local filesystem directory for the root, but essentially almost any
	object type can be the root if needed.


SERVICES A DRIVER PROVIDES...

    An OSD will need to provide serveral important services to the OSML for the
    type of data that it manages.  The most significant of these are summarized
    below.

    A.	Opening and Closing objects

	The driver will need to provide a way of opening and closing objects
	within the subtree of objects that it manages.  In the case of some
	drivers, like the report writer, the subtree is just one object - the
	generated report itself.  In the case of other drivers like a database
	access driver, several different types of objects might be involved:
	rows, columns, the database itself, and so forth.  The driver in such
	cases will need to determine which kind of object is being opened and
	respond accordingly.

    B.	Creating and Deleting objects

	The driver will need to provide the capability to create new objects
	and delete existing ones, if applicable.

    C.	Getting and Setting object attributes

	Objects will have various attributes associated with them.  The driver
	will provide a way for these attributes to be accessed.

    D.	Querying for subobjects

	Many objects will have subobjects (like files in a directory or 
	attachments in an email).  The driver will need to provide a way to
	obtain the list of subobjects for a given object, possibly sorting the
	results or selecting subobjects that meet a criteria, although the OSML
	can itself provide sorting and selection if the driver can't (drivers
	accessing remote data, such as in a database, will be more likely to 
	be able to provide sorting and selection services; others should just
	let the OSML take care of those tasks).

    E.	Executing Methods on objects

	Some objects will have certain methods associated with them, and in
	these cases the driver will need to provide a way to execute the 
	method.  An example of a method would be compacting a CSV datafile that
	has accumulated empty space from deletes or modifications.

    F.	Reading and Writing object content

	For objects that have content, drivers will need to allow for an 
	object's content to be read from and written to.


HOW THE OSML INTERACTS WITH THE DRIVER...

    In this section we'll examine the API between the objectsystem driver and
    the OSML, from the OSML's perspective.  In the next section we'll take a 
    look at it more from the driver's perspective and define some additional
    services the OSML provides to the driver.  For more information about the
    details of these various routines, see the 'objectsystem driver authoring
    guide'.

    A.	Initialization.

	Although outside the context of the OSML at least initially, the first
	thing that happens to a driver is that its Initialize() routine is 
	called when Centrallix first starts up.  The Initialize() routine is 
	not passed any arguments, and should return 0 on success and a negative
	value on failure (either just -1 or -ERROR where ERROR is a value from
	/usr/include/errno.h or the files errno.h includes).

	For an ObjectSystem driver, the Initialize routine is expected to
	register the driver with the OSML so that the OSML knows to use the
	driver for the types of data the driver supports.  For more information
	on registration with the OSML, see the 'objectsystem driver authoring
	guide'.

	    1.	Centrallix --> OSD		Initialize() routine called.
	    2.	               OSD		Driver initializes itself
	    3.	               OSD --> OSML	Driver registers with OSML
	    4.	               OSD <-- OSML	Register succeeds or fails
	    5.	Centrallix <-- OSD		Init succeeds or fails

    B.	Accessing Objects.

	When the OSML needs to access an object handled by the driver, then
	the driver's Open() routine is called.  The result of the Open will be
	a handle (opaque pointer) to the open object from the driver's 
	perspective.  When the OSML is done with the object, it will call the
	Close() routine for that object, passing the same opaque pointer to the 
	driver's Close() routine that was obtained from the Open() routine.

	The driver will need to access the node object via the OSML to figure 
	out where to connect to externally or to obtain the content that it
	should be breaking down into meaningful structure.

	    1.	OSML --> OSD			Open object
	    2.	         OSD --> OSML		Accesses node using OSML API
	    3.	         OSD <-- OSML		Driver gets data for node obj.
	    4.	OSML <-- OSD			Returns object handle

	    5.	OSML --> OSD			Close object
	    6.	         OSD			Cleans up object
	    7.	OSML <-- OSD			Close routine returns

	Here is a more detailed look at how a row in our CSV file from the 
	previous example might be opened.  Note that many of the details have
	been left out in order to highlight the overall process.

	In this view, the various pieces are abbreviated as follows to 
	make things fit on the page:  U=user, O=OSML, R=rootnode driver,
	F=filesystem driver, D=datafile driver.

	    1.	U -> O			User requests that the object
					/DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv/rows/0
					be opened.
	    2.	     O -> R		Open an instance of the / object and
		     O <- R		use that as the first object in the 
					chain of open objects needed to get 
					at the object the user wants.
	    3.	     O			Discovers that rootnode points to a
					local filesystem tree.
	    4.	     O -> F		OSML tries to get local filesystem
					driver to open the given path,
					/DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv/rows/0
	    5.	     O <- F		Filesystem driver reports that it can
					only open /DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv,
					and returns a handle for it.
	    6.	     O			Adds an object to the chain of open
					objects for the open file, and figures
					out that the content of the FileTwo.csv
					is CSV data.
	    7.	     O -> D		OSML tries to get the datafile driver
					to open up FileTwo.csv/rows/0, the
					remainder of the path.
	    8.	          D -> O	datafile driver uses the OSML API to
					access the open object created in 
					step 5 above (the file).
	    9.	               O -> F	OSML requests content for the file from
					the local filesystem driver.
	    10.                O <- F	Local filesystem driver returns the
					needed content.
	    11.	          D <- O	content of the file is returned back
					to the datafile driver.
	    12.	     O <- D		datafile driver reports to the OSML
					that it could open the entire rest of
					the path, FileTwo.csv/rows/0, and 
					returns a handle for that CSV row.
	    13.	     O			Adds a third object to the open object
					chain, for the CSV row, and realizes 
					that entire path has been handled, 
					thus completing the open operation.
	    14. U <- O			An open object handle is returned to
					the user for the CSV row object, 
					accessed via the filesystem file, and
					that accessed via the rootnode.

	In the end of this process, an open object chain has been created which
	contains the following three objects:

	    Rootnode (/)  -->  Local File (FileTwo.csv)  -->  CSV Row (0)

	All that the user sees or cares about is the open CSV row.  However,
	the datafile driver is quite interested in the content of "FileTwo.csv"
	and the local filesystem driver is quite interested in the rootnode
	(so it can find out what directory in the local filesystem to look in
	in order to locate "/DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv").

	Once an object has been accessed, either via the open procedure 
	described here, or via fetching the object from a query, various 
	operations can be performed on the object, including reading/writing
	its content, getting/setting attributes, executing methods, and running
	queries for subobjects.  We'll take a look at queries next.  For each
	of these operations, the OSML will always pass the handle for the 
	object back to the driver so the driver knows what object is being
	dealt with (this is the same value that the driver returns in its
	Open routine, but is not the value that is returned to the user - the
	user sees a pObject pointer, which is a structure the OSML maintains,
	but the driver is passed whatever type of pointer it chose to return
	from its Open routine).

    C.	Querying for Subobjects.

	It is extremely important for the OSML to be able to get a list of 
	subobjects for a given object from the driver.  It will do this by 
	performing a Query.

	Queries at the driver level are only performed on open objects - in 
	order for an object to be queried, it MUST be opened first!

	There are several OSML->driver calls that are involved in a query
	operation:

	    1.	Open		The Open call is used to open the object that
				is to be queried for subobjects.
	    2.	OpenQuery	This routine requests that a query for 
				subobjects be started.  It does not return any
				of the subobjects.
	    3.	QueryFetch	This routine obtains the next item in the query
				results.  It should be completely indistin-
				guishable from an item opened by Open directly
				instead of querying.  In other words, querying
				/File.csv/rows and fetching row 0 should be 
				exactly the same as opening /File.csv/rows/0.
	    4.	QueryClose	Closes an open query, but does not close the 
				objects fetched by the query.  Those will be
				closed with the Close routine, just like 
				objects obtained with Open.
	    5.	Close		Closes an object, whether obtained via Open or
				via QueryFetch.

	Next is an example of how a query might proceed for the three row
	objects in our CSV file example.  For this example, we'll assume that
	/DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv/rows has already been opened as in the
	previous example.  We'll also use the same abbreviations.

	    1.	U -> O			User requests a query of all row 
					objects from /DirectoryOne/FileTwo.csv/
					rows/ which have a row id not equal to 
					1.
	    2.	     O -> D		OSML opens a query on the datafile
					driver asking for all such rows.
	    3.	     O <- D		Datafile driver reports that it can do
					the query but that the selection of 
					matching rows is left up to the OSML,
					and returns a handle for the query.
	    4.	U <- O			OSML returns an open query handle to
					the user (but not the same structure as 
					returned by #3 above).
	    5.	U -> O			User requests that the next subobject
					be fetched.
	    6.	     O -> D		OSML asks the datafile driver for the
					next row object.
	    7.	          D -> O	Datafile driver accesses the local file
					object in order to read the content of
					the CSV row.
	    8.	               O -> F	OSML reads the data from the local file
					itself.
	    9.	               O <- F	Local filesystem driver returns the 
					text of the row at the offset requested
	    10.	          D <- O	OSML returns the text of the row to the
					datafile driver.
	    11.	     O <- D		Datafile driver parses the row into its
					attributes and passes the open row
					object back to the OSML.
	    12.	     O			The OSML examines the object to see if
					it meets the query criteria.  Since the
					row id is 0, which is != 1, the row 
					does match.
	    13.	U <- O			The fetched object is returned to the 
					user.
	    14.	U -> O			User decides to keep the first object
					open for the time being and fetches the
					next one.
	    15.	     O -> D		OSML fetches the next row from the 
					datafile driver.
		...			(detail omitted for brevity)
	    16.	     O <- D		Datafile driver returns the next row,
					with row id 1.
	    17.	     O			OSML examines the object, which does
					not match the criteria.
	    18.	     O -> D		OSML closes the row id 1 object.
	    19.	     O <- D		Datafile driver cleans up the open
					object and returns OK to the OSML.
	    20.	     O -> D		OSML fetches the next row from the 
					datafile driver.
		...			(detail omitted for brevity)
	    21.	     O <- D		Datafile driver returns row id 2.
	    22.	     O			OSML examines the row, which matches
					the criteria.
	    23.	U <- O			Row object is returned to the user.
	    24.	U -> O			User fetches next object.
	    25.	     O -> D		OSML tries to get next row from the
					datafile OSD.
		...			(detail omitted for brevity)
	    26.	     O <- D		Datafile driver returns NULL to say
					that there are no more rows.
	    27.	U <- O			OSML tells user that the row was the
					last row.
	    28.	U -> O			User goes ahead and closes the query,
					but leaves the two row objects open for
					the time. -- objQueryClose()
	    29.	     O -> D		OSML tells the datafile OSD that the 
					query is now closed, via QueryClose.
	    30.	     O <- D		Datafile driver says "OK, closed."
	    31.	U <- O			OSML tells the user the query has now
					been closed, via return from the
					objQueryClose OSML API routine.
	    32.	U -> O			User finally decides to close the first
					row via objClose()
	    33.	     O -> D		OSML calls Close on the row id 0 object
					on the datafile OSD, using the handle
					returned by QueryFetch.
	    34.	     O <- D		Datafile driver says "ok, closed" by
					returning from Close.
	    35.	U <- O			OSML tells user object is closed by
					returning successfully from objClose.
	    36.	U -> O			User finally decides to close the last
					row via objClose()
	    37.	     O -> D		OSML calls Close on the row id 2 object
					on the datafile OSD, using the handle
					returned by QueryFetch.
	    38.	     O <- D		Datafile driver says "ok, closed" by
					returning from Close.
	    39.	U <- O			OSML tells user object is closed by
					returning successfully from objClose.

    D.  Enumerating Attributes of an Object.

	The driver will need to allow the OSML to enumerate all of the object's
	attributes in addition to getting/setting their values.  This is done 
	via the GetFirstAttr and GetNextAttr OSD calls.  GetFirstAttr is used
	to start the enumeration, and returns the name of the first attribute.
	GetNextAttr returns subsequent attributes.  Either can return NULL
	if no more attributes are found.  The following 'system' attributes
	should not be returned by the attribute enumeration functions as they
	must be present on all objects.

	    name		The name (or primary key value) of the object.
	    annotation		An object's annotation.
	    inner_type		(or content_type) - the type of the content of
				an object.
	    content_type	Same as above.
	    outer_type		The type of the object itself.
	
	The system attribute 'last_modification' can be returned in the 
	enumeration if desired, as not all objects will have this attribute,
	though it is important for letting the OSML know when an object has 
	been modified.


HOW THE DRIVER INTERACTS WITH THE OSML...

    The objectsystem driver will need to use the OSML for several important
    things.

    First, the OSML provides a number of convenience or utility functions that
    the driver will likely use in the course of operation.  For more details
    on these, see the 'objectsystem driver authoring guide'.

    Second the driver will use the normal OSML API for accessing not only its
    node object (obj->Prev internally) but also for accessing any other objects
    that it might need along the way (like the report writer OSD might do).
    Below is a quick list of some of the OSML API routines:

	objOpen		objClose	objCreate	objDelete
	objOpenQuery	objQueryFetch	objQueryClose	objQueryDelete
	objGetAttrType	objGetAttrValue	objSetAttrValue	objAddAttr
	objRead		objWrite	objGetFirstAttr	objGetNextAttr
	objGetFirstMethod		objGetNextMethod
	objExecMethod	objInfo		objCommit
	objOpenSession	objCloseSession	objPresentationHints
