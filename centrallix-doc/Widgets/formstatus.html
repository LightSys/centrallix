<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">
			<p>Many times with multi-mode forms like those offered by Centrallix, the end-user can become confused as to what the form is currently &quot;doing&quot; (for instance, is a blank form with a blinking cursor in a &quot;new&quot; state or &quot;enter query&quot; state?).  Centrallix helps to address this issue using the form status widget. A form status widget displays the current mode of operation that a form is in, as well as whether the form is busy processing a query, save, or delete operation.  This clear presentation of the form's mode is intended to clear up any confusion created by a multi-mode form.  This widget is a special-case form element.</p>
		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
<span class="usage">
			<p>The form status widget can only be used either directly or indirectly within a form widget.  It can contain no visual widgets.</p>
