<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">

			<p>The objectsource (osrc) widget lies at the core of Centrallix's ability to dynamically exchange data between the server and client. This widget implements a form of "replication" by maintaining a replica of a small segment of data in the user agent.</p>

			<p>Both form and dynamic table widgets interact with the objectsource nonvisual widget to acquire data, update data, create data, and delete data. In fact, it is possible for more than one form and/or table to be connected with a given objectsource, to perform a variety of functions.</p>

			<p>Objectsources offer synchronization with other objectsources via the Sync and DoubleSync actions (see below) or rule-based connnectivity (see widget/rule).  These actions allow the application to contain multiple objectsources with primary key / foreign key relationships, and to have those objectsources automatically stay in synchronization with each other based on those relationships.</p>

			<p>An objectsource may also be used to run a query which does not return any rows, such as an insert, update, or delete query.  Under normal data maintenance conditions such queries are not needed as the objectsource handles those operations internally, however.</p>

		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
<span class="usage">

			<p>Objectsource widgets are often used at the top-level of an application, within a "widget/page" object, but can be used anywhere.  The forms/tables that use an objectsource are generally placed within that objectsource.  A page may have more than one objectsource widget.</p>

			<p>Even though the objectsource is nonvisual, it is, like the form widget, a container, and can (should!) contain other visual and nonvisual widgets.</p>

<td class="name">autoquery</td>
<td class="type">string</td>
<td class="description">One of oneachreveal, never, onload, onfirstreveal.  (note: this autoquery setting is different from, but related to, the "widget/rule" "autoquery").  "onload" means that the osrc should run its query automatically when the .app containing this osrc is loaded by the user.  "onfirstreveal" means that the osrc should run its query automatically when the data (e.g., a table or form) is first displayed to the user (e.g., the containing childwindow becomes visible or tabpage is selected).  "oneachreveal" means to do so *each* time the data is displayed to the user.  "never" means that the osrc should never query automatically by itself, but it may be triggered by a connector (QueryParam, QueryText, etc.) or by a widget/rule of type osrc_relationship.  Important Note:  If you expect to normally trigger the osrc via a relationship or via QueryParam, it is often *best* to set autoquery to 'never'.  Otherwise, unexpected results can sometimes occur.</td>
