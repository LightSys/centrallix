<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">

			<p>The childwindow provides the capability of creating a popup dialog or application window within a web page.  The window is not actually a separate browser window, but rather a movable container that can appear "floating" above the rest of the Centrallix application.They can take on one of two styles;"dialog" and "window", which currently relate only to how the window border and titlebar are drawn.  The windows support windowshading (double-clicking on the titlebar to "rollup" or "rolldown" the window contents).</p>

			<p>These "windows" currently do not support multiple instantiation.</p>

		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
<span class="usage">

			<p>Childwindows are normally coded at the top-level of an application, since if they are placed within containers, the container limits where the window can be moved (the window is clipped by its container).  However, if the "toplevel" property is enabled, then the window floats at the top level of other widgets regardless of the size and location of its container in the application or component (thus the window is not clipped by its container).</p>

			<p>These windows can contain other visual and nonvisual widgets.</p>
