<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">

			<p>The remote control manager nonvisual widget allows for one application (or instance of an application) to activate Actions in another running application, even if those applications are on two separate client computer systems. This is done by passing the event/action information through a remote control channel on the server.</p>

			<p>Two remote control widgets are required: a master and slave. This widget is the master widget, which sends remote control events via the Centrallix server. When a this widget sends an event through the channel, the slave widget (remotectl) is automatically activated and can then trigger the appropriate action on another widget on the remote application's page.</p>

			<p>In order for the remote control event to be passed through Centrallix, the master and slave widgets must both be using the same channel id and be logged in with the same username.They need not be a part of the same session on the server.</p>

			<p>Note: at the time of this writing, the remotemgr widget was not yet written.</p>
