<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">

			<p>The remote control nonvisual widget allows for one application (or instance of an application) to activate Actions in another running application, even if those applications are on two separate client computer systems. This is done by passing the event/action information through a remote control channel on the server.</p>

			<p>Two remote control widgets are required: a master and slave. This widget is the slave widget, which receives remote control events via the Centrallix server. When a master widget (remotemgr) sends an event through the channel, this slave widget is automatically activated and can then trigger the appropriate action on another widget on the page.</p>

			<p>In order for the remote control event to be passed through Centrallix, the master and slave widgets must both be using the same channel id and be logged in with the same username.They need not be a part of the same session on the server.</p>

			<p>Note: at the time of this writing, the remotectl widget was not yet operational.</p>

		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
<span class="usage">

			<p>The remote control widget is a nonvisual widget and thus cannot contain visual widgets.  It is normally located at the top-level of an application, within a "widget/page" object.</p>
