	<widget name="autolayout" type="widget/autolayout" description="Container which automatically positions its children" visual="yes" formelement="no" container="yes" osrcclient="no">

		<overview>

			<p>The autolayout widget is used to automatically position widgets without having to explicitly provide x, y, width, and height values for those widgets.  Most of the layout in Centrallix is done on a coordinate basis (although the automatic resize logic adjusts those coordinates to fit the target application or component render size).  The autolayout widget provides the capability to do nested gui layout in Centrallix, where the coordinate positions of the widgets are computed automatically.</p>

			<p>Normally, the autolayout widget is used not as "widget/autolayout", but as "widget/hbox" or "widget/vbox", two synonyms for this widget which also set the layout direction (horizontal or vertical).</p>

			<p>A "hbox" widget stacks its children horizontally one after the other, while a "vbox" widget stacks its children vertically from the top down.  The spacing between children can be set, and the size of each child can be either independently set per-child, or it can be set by virtue of the geometry of the autolayout widget.</p>

			<p>The autolayout widget supports having multiple rows or columns of widgets.  That is, if a "vbox" widget fills up vertically, it can resume adding children to a second vertical column should there be space to the right of the original column of widgets.  For this to work, the width of the columns (for a vbox) or the height of the rows (for an hbox) must be specified.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The autolayout widget can occur any place that a visual widget can be placed.  As it is a container, it can also contain both visual and nonvisual widgets and containers.</p>

		</usage>

		<properties>

			<property name="align" type="string">Sets the alignment of text  can have left (default) right or center.</property>

			<property name="column_width" type="integer">This specifies the width of columns for a vbox -- should the first column of widgets fill up, a second column will be started at this offset from the start of the first column.</property>

			<property name="height" type="integer">Height, in pixels, of the autolayout area.  If omitted, it defaults to the maximum available height for the given width, without overlapping other visible widgets.  If both width and height are unspecified, Centrallix will chose a width and height that maximize the available autolayout area.</property>

			<property name="justify" type="string">Makes the text fill page (justifies text - google it if you need).</property>
			
			<property name="row_height" type="integer">This specifies the height of rows for an hbox -- should the first row of widgets fill up horizontally, a second row will be started beneath the first one, at this vertical offset from the start of the first row.</property>

			<property name="spacing" type="integer">The spacing, in pixels, between widgets.  For an hbox, this refers to the horizontal spacing between children.  For a vbox, this refers to the vertical spacing.</property>

	<widget name="calendar" type="widget/calendar" description="Calendar-type view of event/schedule type data in an objectsource" visual="yes" formelement="no" container="no" osrcclient="yes">

		<overview>

			<p>The calendar widget is used to present event/schedule types of data in a year, month, week, or day format.  The data for the events on the calendar is obtained from an objectsource's query results, and as such, can be controlled via queries and other forms/tables associated with the same objectsource.  The four formats are listed below and can be selected during app run-time.</p>

			<ul>

			    <li><b>Year</b> - Presents twelve months at a time in a low-detail type of setting; when events occur on a day, the day is highlighted, but no more data than that is displayed.  If the user points the mouse at a given day, it will display in a popup "tooltip" type of manner the events associated with that day.  If more than one year's worth of data is in the objectsource's replica, then multiple years are displayed one after the other.  Each year is displayed as four rows of three months each, in traditional calendar format.</li>

			    <li><b>Month</b> - Presents one month's worth of data in a medium-detail display.  For each month with data in the objectsource, the calendar will display the month as multiple rows, each row containing one week's worth of days.  The calendar will attempt to display the various entries for each day, in order of priority, but will limit the amount of data displayed to keep the boxes for the days approximately visually square.  Pointing at a day will show the events for the day in a popup, and pointing at an event in the day will show the details for that event.</li>

			    <li><b>Week</b> - Presents one week's worth of data in a high-detail display.  For each week with data in the objectsource, the calendar will display the week as seven days with a large vertical extent capable of displaying all events for the day.  The left edge of the display will contain times during the day for the day's events to line up with.</li>

			    <li><b>Day</b> - Presents an entire day's worth of data in a high-detail display.  For each day with data in the objectsource, the calendar will display the day in full-width, with the day's events listed chronologically from top to bottom.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>It should be noted that all of the data for the calendar must fit into the objectsource, or else the calendar will not display all of the available data.  In this manner the calendar's display must be controlled via the objectsource's data.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The calendar widget can be placed inside of any visual container, but because its height can change, it is often placed inside of a scrollpane widget.  This widget may not contain other visual widgets.</p>

		</usage>

		<properties>

			<property name="background" type="string">An image for the background of the calendar widget.  Should be an ObjectSystem path.</property>

			<property name="bgcolor" type="string">A color, either named or numeric (RGB), for the background of the calendar.  If neither bgcolor nor background are specified, the calendar's background is transparent.</property>

			<property name="displaymode" type="string">The visual display mode of the calendar - can be 'year', 'month', 'week', or 'day' (see the overview, above, for details on these modes).  Defaults to 'year'.</property>

			<property name="eventdatefield" type="string">The name of the date/time field in the datasource containing the event date/time.  A mandatory field.</property>

			<property name="eventdescfield" type="string">The name of the string field in the datasource containing the event's full description.  If not supplied, descriptions will be omitted.</property>

			<property name="eventnamefield" type="string">The name of the string field in the datasource containing the event's short name.  A mandatory field.</property>

			<property name="eventpriofield" type="string">The name of the integer field in the datasource containing the event's priority.  If not supplied, priority checking is disabled.</property>

			<property name="height" type="integer">The height of the calendar, in pixels.  If not specified, the calendar may grow vertically an indefinite amount in order to display its given data.  If specified, however, the calendar will be limited to that size.</property>

			<property name="minpriority" type="integer">The minimum priority level for events that will be displayed on the calendar; the values for this integer depend on the nature of the 'priority' field in the data source; only events with priority values numerically higher than or equal to this minimum priority will be displayed.  Defaults to 0.</property>
			
			<property name="textcolor" type="string">The color of the words in the calendar.</property>
			
			<property name="width" type="integer">The width of the calendar, in pixels.</property>

			<property name="x" type="integer">X-coordinate of the upper left corner of the calendar, default is 0.</property>

		<overview>

			<p>The childwindow provides the capability of creating a popup dialog or application window within a web page.  The window is not actually a separate browser window, but rather a movable container that can appear "floating" above the rest of the Centrallix application.They can take on one of two styles;"dialog" and "window", which currently relate only to how the window border and titlebar are drawn.  The windows support windowshading (double-clicking on the titlebar to "rollup" or "rolldown" the window contents).</p>

			<p>These "windows" currently do not support multiple instantiation.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Childwindows are normally coded at the top-level of an application, since if they are placed within containers, the container limits where the window can be moved (the window is clipped by its container).  However, if the "toplevel" property is enabled, then the window floats at the top level of other widgets regardless of the size and location of its container in the application or component (thus the window is not clipped by its container).</p>

			<p>These windows can contain other visual and nonvisual widgets.</p>

			<p>This widget is used to instantiate a custom component that has already been defined using a widget/component-decl widget, typically inside a ".cmp" file.  The instantiation can be either static or dynamic:  a static component is rendered along with the component or application that it resides inside, whereas a dynamic component is loaded as needed from the client.  Components may also allow multiple instantiation when dynamic, which is especially beneficial with components whose top-level widget happens to be a widget/childwindow.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>A component can be either visual or non-visual, and can be placed at almost any point in the application.</p>

			<p>At the time of writing, only connectors may be placed inside a widget/component.

	<widget name="component-decl" type="widget/component-decl" description="A widget which defines a custom component" visual="yes" formelement="no" container="yes" osrcclient="no">

		<overview>

			<p>The component-decl widget is used to define a new component which can be used and reused in other applications or components.  Creating a component is very similar to creating an application - except that the top-level widget in a component is "widget/component-decl" instead of "widget/page".</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>A widget/component-decl widget must occur at the top level of a component (.cmp) file.</p>

			<p>Other visual and nonvisual widgets may be placed inside a component-decl, in addition to parameters and declarations of Events and Actions that the component generates and handles.</p>

			<p>To declare that a component generates an Event, place a "widget/component-decl-event" inside the component at the top level.  No parameters are needed for that Event.  To cause the component to generate the Event, trigger an Action with the same name on the component-decl from inside, and the event will be activated for the containing application or component.</p>

			<p>Similarly, to declare that a component can receive an Action, place a "widget/component-decl-action" inside the component at the top level.  Again, no parameters are needed.  The containing application or component can then trigger the Action, which will cause an event to occur inside the component.  The event occurs on the component-decl widget (top level of the component), and can be caught with a connector widget.</p>

			<p>Components can take parameters just like applications can.  See the "widget/parameter" widget for details on how to declare parameters on applications and components.</p>

			<p>Several of the properties of a component-decl are used to make it easy to wrap another widget or component.  The expose_actions_for, expose_events_for, and expose_properties_for properties cause the actions, events, and properties of a widget or component inside the component-decl to be exposed to the "outside world".  The apply_hints_to property causes any presentation hints ("widget/hints") that are applied in the instantiation of a component-decl (inside the "widget/component") to be applied to the specified widget or component inside the component-decl.</p>

		</usage>

		<properties>

			<property name="apply_hints_to" type="string">Specifies a widget inside the component-decl that will receive any presentation hints constraints ("widget/hints") that are applied to the instantiation of this component-decl.</property>

			<property name="expose_actions_for" type="string">Specifies a widget inside the component-decl whose actions (methods) we want to expose on the external interface of this component-decl.</property>

			<property name="expose_events_for" type="string">Specifies a widget inside the component-decl whose events we want to expose on the external interface of this component-decl.</property>

			<property name="expose_properties_for" type="string">Specifies a widget inside the component-decl whose client-side properties we want to expose on the external interface of this component-decl.</property>

	<widget name="connector" type="widget/connector" description="A nonvisual widget used to trigger an Action on a widget when an Event on another widget fires." visual="no" formelement="no" container="no">

		<overview>

			<p>Each widget can have events and actions associated with it. The events occur when certain things occur via the user interface, via timers, or even as a result of data being loaded from the server.  Actions cause certain things to happen to or within a certain widget, for example causing an HTML layer to reload with a new page, or causing a scrollable area to scroll up or down.</p>

			<p>The connector widget allows an event to be linked with an action without actually writing any JavaScript code to do so -- the connector object is created, and given an event to trigger it and an action to perform when it is triggered.</p>

			<p>Events and actions can have parameters, which specify more information about the occurrence of an event, or which specify more information about how to perform the action.  Such parameters from events can be linked into parameters for actions via the connector widget as well.</p>

			<p>When supplying a parameter to a connector (other than "action", "event", and "target"), there are several ways that parameter can be specified.  First the parameter can be a constant value, defined explicitly in the application.  Second, the parameter can be an expression which is evaluated on the client (using the runclient() pseudo-function) and which can change based on the conditions under which the connector is triggered.  In this latter case, the runclient() expression can contain parameters supplied by the event, or values supplied by other widgets.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The connector object should be a sub-object of the widget which will trigger the event.  Any widget with events can contain connectors as subwidgets.More than one connector may be attached to another widget's event.</p>

			<p>An example connector would link the click of a URL in a treeview with the loading of a new page in an HTML area.  See the Example source code at the end of this document to see how this is done.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>An editbox form element widget allows the display and data entry of a single line of text (or a numeric value).  When the editbox is clicked (and thus receives keyboard focus), the user can type and erase data inside the widget.  Data which does not fit will cause the text to scroll.  When it receives keyboard focus, the editbox displays a flashing I-beam cursor.  The cursor color uses the data focus color for the page (default is '#000080', or dark blue).</p>

			<p>  When an editbox is part of a form and the form goes into query mode the editbox has several additional features.  First, you can use the * operator as a wildcard (e.g. *ber matches September, October, November, December).  Second you can enter a range if the field is numeric (e.g. 1-100).  Thirdly, a list of criteria can be specified, separated by commas.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The editbox can be placed within any visual widget (or within a form widget).  Editboxes automatically attach themselves to the form which contains them (whether directly or indirectly).  Editboxes cannot contain visual widgets.</p>

		<usage>

			<p>The execmethod widget, since it is nonvisual, can be placed almost anywhere but is typically placed at the top-level (within an object of type "widget/page") for clarity's sake. It has no effect on its container.These widgets cannot contain visual widgets, and since they have no Events, normally contain no connector widgets either.</p>

	<widget name="form" type="widget/form" visual="no" formelement="no" container="yes" description="A nonvisual container used to group a set of form element widgets into a single record or object">

		<overview>

			<p>The form widget is used as a high-level container for form elements.  Essentially, a form widget represents a single record of data, or the attributes of a single object in the objectsystem (or of a single query result set object). Form widgets must be used in conjunction with an ObjectSource widget, which does the actual transferring of data to and from the server.</p>

			<p>Forms have five different "modes"of operation, each of which can be specifically allowed or disallowed for the form.</p>

		<ol>

		<li> No Data - form inactive/disabled, no data viewed/edited.</li>

		<li> View - data being viewed readonly.</li>

		<li> Modify - existing data being modified.</li>

		<li> Query - query criteria being entered (used for query-by-form applications)</li>

		<li> New - new object being entered/created.</li>

		</ol>

			<p>Occasionally, the user may perform an operation which inherently disregards that the form may contain unsaved data.  When this occurs and there is newly created or modified data in the form, the application must ask the user whether the data in the form should be saved or discarded, or whether to simply not even perform the operation in question.  Since DHTML does not inherently have a "three-way confirm" message box (with save, discard, and cancel buttons), Centrallix allows a form to specify a "three-way confirm" window.  This should be a hidden (visible=no) "widget/htmlwindow" object which may contain any content, but should at least contain three buttons named "_3bConfirmSave", "_3bConfirmDiscard", and "_3bConfirmCancel" directly in the htmlwindow.  During a confirm operation, this window will become "application-modal"; that is, no other widgets in the application may be accessed by the user until one of the three buttons is pushed.</p>

			<p>Several settings on the form widget control what state, or "mode", the form can be in: allow_query, allow_new, allow_modify, allow_view, and allow_nodata.  These can beused to constrain a form to perform a specific task, such as only searching, or only creating new records.  For example, a form with only allow_search enabled will always return to the search (QBF) mode and will never display the searched-for data that is returned in the objectsource.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Although the form widget itself is nonvisual in nature, it can contain visual widgets, including other containers, which may then in turn contain form elements as well.  The form widget may be contained within any widget with a visual container (otherwise, the form elements would not show up on the page).</p>

"lastsave" means to move to the next form field, but once ENTER is pressed on the very last field, to then save the record.  Most people prefer "save" for this, since that is consistent with how normal applications work, but people in finance or accounting work often prefer "lastsave" since it allows them to perform high-speed data entry using a numeric keypad.</property>

			<p>Many times with multi-mode forms like those offered by Centrallix, the end-user can become confused as to what the form is currently "doing" (for instance, is a blank form with a blinking cursor in a "new" state or "enter query" state?).  Centrallix helps to address this issue using the form status widget. A form status widget displays the current mode of operation that a form is in, as well as whether the form is busy processing a query, save, or delete operation.  This clear presentation of the form's mode is intended to clear up any confusion created by a multi-mode form.  This widget is a special-case form element.</p>

			<p>The HTML area widget provides a way to insert a plain HTML document into a Centrallix generated page, either in-flow (static) or in its own separate layer that can be reloaded at will (dynamic). The HTML document can either be given in a property of the widget or can be referenced so that the HTML is read from an external document.</p>

			<p>The HTML area widget also can act as a mini-browser -- clicking on hyper-text links in the visible document will by default cause the link to be followed, and the new document to be displayed in the HTML area (if the HTML area is dynamic).</p>

		<overview>

			<p>The ImageButton widget provides a clickable button that is comprised of a set of two or three images.The first image is shown normally when the button is idle, the second when the button is pointed-to, and the third image is shown when the button is actually clicked.  This provides a "tri-state" appearance much like that provided by buttons in modern user interfaces, although the button can be two-state, with just an "unclicked" and "clicked" version of the image.</p>

			<p>The images are automatically swapped out when the appropriate mouse events occur on the button.</p>

			<p>ImageButtons can also be disabled, and a "disabled" image is displayed at that time.</p>

			<p>Unlike the textbutton, there is no 'tristate' property for an imagebutton; to make an imagebutton tri-state (different image when idle vs. when pointed to), use a 'pointimage', otherwise do not specify 'pointimage'.</p>

			<p>Note: as of the time of writing, menu widgets were not yet properly functional.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Menus can be placed inside of any visual container. However, be aware that the menu will be clipped by its container, so placing them at the top-level can be of an advantage. Menu widgets contain menuitem widgets, which are also described in this section.</p>

	<widget name="osrc" type="widget/osrc" visual="no" formelement="no" container="yes" description="A nonvisual widget which handles data communication between forms/tables and the Centrallix server.">

		<overview>

			<p>The objectsource (osrc) widget lies at the core of Centrallix's ability to dynamically exchange data between the server and client. This widget implements a form of "replication" by maintaining a replica of a small segment of data in the user agent.</p>

			<p>Both form and dynamic table widgets interact with the objectsource nonvisual widget to acquire data, update data, create data, and delete data. In fact, it is possible for more than one form and/or table to be connected with a given objectsource, to perform a variety of functions.</p>

			<p>Objectsources offer synchronization with other objectsources via the Sync and DoubleSync actions (see below) or rule-based connnectivity (see widget/rule).  These actions allow the application to contain multiple objectsources with primary key / foreign key relationships, and to have those objectsources automatically stay in synchronization with each other based on those relationships.</p>

			<p>An objectsource may also be used to run a query which does not return any rows, such as an insert, update, or delete query.  Under normal data maintenance conditions such queries are not needed as the objectsource handles those operations internally, however.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Objectsource widgets are often used at the top-level of an application, within a "widget/page" object, but can be used anywhere.  The forms/tables that use an objectsource are generally placed within that objectsource.  A page may have more than one objectsource widget.</p>

			<p>Even though the objectsource is nonvisual, it is, like the form widget, a container, and can (should!) contain other visual and nonvisual widgets.</p>

		</usage>

		<properties>

			<property name="autoquery" type="string">One of oneachreveal, never, onload, onfirstreveal.  (note: this autoquery setting is different from, but related to, the "widget/rule" "autoquery").  "onload" means that the osrc should run its query automatically when the .app containing this osrc is loaded by the user.  "onfirstreveal" means that the osrc should run its query automatically when the data (e.g., a table or form) is first displayed to the user (e.g., the containing childwindow becomes visible or tabpage is selected).  "oneachreveal" means to do so *each* time the data is displayed to the user.  "never" means that the osrc should never query automatically by itself, but it may be triggered by a connector (QueryParam, QueryText, etc.) or by a widget/rule of type osrc_relationship.  Important Note:  If you expect to normally trigger the osrc via a relationship or via QueryParam, it is often *best* to set autoquery to 'never'.  Otherwise, unexpected results can sometimes occur.</property>

			<property name="baseobj" type="string">If inserts and deletes are to function, the ObjectSystem pathname in which those inserts and deletes should occur.  This should be one of the objects specified in the FROM clause of the SQL statement.</property>

			<property name="filter" type="string">Set of search parameters.</property>
			
			<property name="indicates_activity" type="yes/no">Whether normal query activity on this objectsource indicates to the server that the user is active.  Some objectsources (in conjunction with a widget/timer) regularly refresh their data; for those, indicates_activity can be set to "no" so that those refreshes don't cause a user's session to never time-out.</property>

			<property name="key_objname" type="string">The name of the object in the SQL query that contains the primary key for the query.</property>

			<property name="readahead" type="integer">Represents the number to fetch from the server when more records are needed from the server (such as when a form requests that the Current Record be a record beyond the end of the current replica contents).</property>

			<property name="receive_updates" type="yes/no">** This feature currently disabled in Centrallix 0.9.1 **  Default "no".  If set to "yes", the objectsource will ask the server to send it updates on any changes that occur on the server side (i.e., if the changes were made by another objectsource or by another user, they would be automatically refreshed into this objectsource in near real-time).</property>

			<property name="refresh_interval" type="integer">The time between the data refreshing, if set to 0 it does not automatically refresh.</property>
		
			<property name="replicasize" type="integer">Represents the number of records to store in its replica.  This value should be larger than the maximum number of records that will be displayed at any one time.  At times, Centrallix may increase the number of records cached on the client beyond this number.</property>

			<property name="revealed_only" type="string">Acts as a boolean and delays query until the osrc is visable (if "true").</property>

			<property name="scrollahead" type="integer">Similar to readahead, but relates to how many records should be fetched when more records are needed from the server to fulfill a request to display more data, such as a table widget scrolling without changing the current record.  By default this is set to the value of 'readahead'.</property>

			<property name="send_updates" type="yes/no">Default "yes".  If set to "no", the objectsource will not relay any updates (modifications, etc.) that the user makes to the server.</property>

			<property name="sql" type="string">The SQL statement used to retrieve the data.</property>

			<property name="use_having_clause" type="yes/no">Default "no".  If set to "yes", then queries will be performed using a HAVING clause instead of a WHERE clause.</property>

If the master osrc has a NULL value for its key (as defined by key_#/target_key_#), this setting determines how the slave (child) osrc behaves.  'allrecs' and 'norecs' have the same meaning as for master_norecs_action.  'nullisvalue' means to treat the NULL as a value, and query for slave records that have a matching NULL values in their key (as defined by key_#/target_key_#).

'query' contains a space-separated list of strings that must be present in each returned record (typically the 'query' is typed by the user).  'field_list' is a comma-separated list of field names to search in.  Each field name (attribute) can be preceded by a * or followed by a *; the presence of these asterisks controls whether the matching is done on the entire attribute value or just as a substring match.

	<widget name="page" type="widget/page" visual="yes" formelement="no" container="yes" description="The top-level container that represents a Centrallix application.">

		<overview>

			<p>The page widget represents the HTML application (or subapplication) as a whole and serves as a top-level container for other widgets in the application.  The page widget also implements some important functionality regarding the management of keypresses, focus, widget resizing, and event management. When creating an application, the top-level object in the application must either be "widget/page" or "widget/frameset", where the latter is used to create a multi-framed application containing multiple page widgets.</p>

			<p>Page widgets specify the colors for mouse, keyboard, and data focus for the application.  Focus is usually indicated via the drawing of a rectangle around a widget or data item, and for a 3D-effect two colors are specified for each type of focus: a color for the top and left of the rectangle, and another color for the right and bottom of the rectangle.  Mouse focus gives feedback to the user as to which widget they are pointing at (and thus which one will receive keyboard and/or data focus if the user clicks the mouse).  Keyboard focus tells the user which widget will receive data entered via the keyboard.  Data focus tells the user which record or data item is selected in a widget.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The page widget cannot be embedded within other widgets on a page. There must only be one per page, unless a frameset is used, in which case page widgets may be added within a frameset widget.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>Applications (.app) and components (.cmp) can accept parameters, which can then be used to control the way that the application or component is rendered or the way it functions.  The widget/parameter widget is used to declare a parameter on an application or component, and to specify data type, default values, and more.  ObjectSource widgets can also have parameters, which are used when running the ObjectSource's SQL query.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Parameters must be placed inside a widget/page, widget/component-decl, or widget/osrc.  They cannot be used anywhere else, and cannot contain other widgets.</p>

			<p>Parameters have a very similar set of properties to the widget/hints widget, which is used to attach "presentation hints" to a widget.</p>

			<p>To use a parameter value, just reference it in a runserver() expression with object "this", as in :this:parametername.  For "object" parameters, reference them by just using the parameter name as if you would use the name of the object itself if the object were physically present in the component instead of being passed as a parameter (see sample code).</p>

To override this behavior, set this option to "yes".</property>

			<property name="find_container" type="string">If this is a parameter to a component, and the parameter has type "object", this can be set to a type of widget that should be searched for in the containing application or component once the component is instantiated.

		<overview>

			<p>A radio button panel widget is a form element used to create a set of radio buttons on screen.  Only one radio button may be selected at a time.  When the form goes into query mode the radio buttons change into checkboxes and more than one can be selected at a time.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The radio button panel can be placed inside of any visual container, and will automatically attach itself to a form widget if it is inside of one (directly or indirectly).  The "widget/radiobuttonpanel" is the main widget, and can contain any number of "widget/radiobutton" widgets which specify the choices which will be present on the panel.  No other visual widgets can be contained within a radio button panel.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>The remote control nonvisual widget allows for one application (or instance of an application) to activate Actions in another running application, even if those applications are on two separate client computer systems.

When a master widget (remotemgr) sends an event through the channel, this slave widget is automatically activated and can then trigger the appropriate action on another widget on the page.</p>

			<p>In order for the remote control event to be passed through Centrallix, the master and slave widgets must both be using the same channel id and be logged in with the same username.They need not be a part of the same session on the server.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>The TabControl widget provides a DHTML tab control within Centrallix. The widget behaves in the same way as tab controls in other GUI environments, providing a set of tab pages, layered one on top of the other, which can be selected (brought to the foreground) by clicking the mouse on the respective visible tab at the top of the tab control.</p>

			<p>To further distinguish which tab at the top of the tab control is active, this widget slightly modifies the X/Y position of the tab as well as changing a thumbnail image (on the left edge of the tab) to further enhance the distinction between selected and inactive tab pages.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>The tab pages are containers, and as such, controls of various kinds, including other tab controls, can be placed inside the tab pages.</p>

			<p>Tab pages are added to a tab control by including widgets of type "widget/tabpage" within the "widget/tab" widget in the structure file that defines the application. Any controls to appear inside a particular tab page should be placed inside their respective "widget/tabpage" widgets in the structure file.Only widgets of type "widget/tabpage" should be placed inside a "widget/tab", with the exception of nonvisuals such as connectors.</p>

			<p>Tab pages also have a 'visible' property which allows them to be hidden and revealed.  This is used if the type is set to dynamic, but can be used manually as well.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>A table widget is used to display data in a tabular format. It consists of a header row with column labels, followed by any number of rows containing data.The header may have a different color or image scheme than the rows, and the rows may or may not be configured to alternate between two colors or background images.</p>

		<span class='__TEXT__'>Table widgets come in three different flavors: static, dynamicpage, and dynamicrow.Static table widgets are built on the server and write their data directly into the container in which they reside, which is usually a scrollpane widget.  Dynamicpage table widgets load their data once they initialize on the client, by activating a query through an ObjectSource nonvisual widget.Dynamicpage table widgets do not support modification, but can be reloaded through an ObjectSource at will.Dynamicrow table widgets, on the other hand, display each row as an individual layer, and thus are modifiable on the client. Dynamicrow table widgets also load their contents through an ObjectSource widget query.As of the time of writing of this document, only <i>static</i> mode and <i>dynamicrow</i> mode were supported.</span>

			<p>Table widgets allow the selection (keyboard, mouse, and data focus) of individual rows.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Table widgets are normally placed inside of a scrollpane so that any rows which don't fit int the container can still be viewed. Table columns are created via "widget/table-column" child widgets within the table widget.</p>

		<overview>

			<p>A treeview provides a way of viewing hierarchically-organized data via a "traditional" GUI point-and-click tree structure. A treeview has "branches" that can expand and collapse entire subtrees of data.</p>

			<p>Centrallix treeviews present a subtree of the ObjectSystem, with the data dynamically loaded, on demand, from the server as the widget is used. The treeview widget thus has no intelligence in and of itself in determining what kinds of objects are presented at each level of the tree. Many times, this is exactly what is desired because the treeview is being used to simply browse objects in the ObjectSystem, such as directories and files. In other cases, the treeview is teamed up with a special ObjectSystem object called a "querytree" (QYT) object. The querytree object creates a hierarchical view from other potentially non-hierarchical data in the ObjectSystem, such as that from different database tables and so forth.</p>

		</overview>

		<usage>

			<p>Treeviews can be placed inside of any visual container, but are usually placed inside of a scrollpane, since scrollpanes can expand to allow the user to view data that would not normally fit inside the desired container. Treeviews can contain only nonvisual widgets such as connectors.</p>
