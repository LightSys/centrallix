Place the centrallix.lang file in the following directory (in linux)

/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs

You may need to change permissions on this folder.

This file is for gedit, and it is very easy to 
add new keywords and function names.

To use this language file as a syntax highlighter, do one of the following
1)      open a *.cmp in gedit, then go to
        View -> Highlight Mode -> Source -> Centrallix

2)      Place centrallix.xml into the following directory
        (again, you may need to change permissions for this folder)
        
        /usr/share/mime/packages
        
        Then run the following commmand in the terminal
        
        sudo update-mime-database mime

The second option will cause any .cmp, .app, .struct, and .rpt files
to be automatically assigned to the Centrallix type highlighting.
