Developer Toolchain Recommendations
===================================
See centrallix-sysdoc/DeveloperTools.md for suggestions on how to set up your Centrallix + Kardia development environment.

Centrallix Syntax Highlighting
==============================

For gedit
---------
Place the centrallix.lang file in the following directory (in linux)

/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs

You may need to change permissions on this folder.

This file is for gedit, and it is very easy to 
add new keywords and function names.

To use this language file as a syntax highlighter, do one of the following
1)      open a *.cmp in gedit, then go to
        View -> Highlight Mode -> Source -> Centrallix

2)      Place centrallix.xml into the following directory
        (again, you may need to change permissions for this folder)
        
        /usr/share/mime/packages
        
        Then run the following commmand in the terminal
        
        sudo update-mime-database mime

The second option will cause any .cmp, .app, .struct, and .rpt files
to be automatically assigned to the Centrallix type highlighting.

For nano
--------
execute the following commands

cd /usr/local/src/cx-git/centrallix-dev-tools
sudo cp nanorc /etc
sudo cp cx.nanorc /usr/share/nano

(Please do check that you're not overwriting an existing nanorc and that these
directories exist)

For Vi/Vim
----------
execute the following commands

cd /usr/local/src/cx-git/centrallix-dev-tools
sudo cp .vimrc ~
sudo cp cx.vim /usr/share/vim/vim70/syntax/cx.vim

(Please do check that you're not overwriting an existing .vimrc and that these
directories exist)

For VSCode
----------
Install the Centrallix Syntax Highlighting extension from the VSCode Marketplace: 
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightsys.centrallix-syntax-highlighting

Once installed, it should automatically syntax highlight any files with a .cmp,
.qy, .qyt, .app, .rpt, .spec, or .struct extension.

The source for the plugin is here:
https://github.com/sheesania/centrallix-syntax-highlighting

The Marketplace extension is managed by a Microsoft account under Alison
Blomenberg's LightSys email.

Other
-----
Centrallix.g and Centrallix2.g are ANTLR grammars (https://www.antlr.org/) that
were last worked on in 2011 (possibly for a NetBeans plugin?). Their current
status and how well they work is unknown.
