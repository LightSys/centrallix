* Clarified fdRead() modifications by using addl_read local variable.
* Fix fdRead() bug where recursive call to fdRead() could return -1 on error
  or on a blocking condition, causing the returned length value to be off by
  one.
* Fixed a few buffer overflows and robustness considerations (e.g. return
  values from fdRead/fdWrite) in nht_internal_ParsePostPayload.
* TBD: change nht_internal_ParsePostPayload to not depend on the specific order
  of the POST request headers.
