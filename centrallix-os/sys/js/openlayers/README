Revision History:

20-Mar-2012:	OpenLayers 2.11

The 'tests', 'examples', and 'docs' directories have been removed from this
copy of OpenLayers so we aren't distributing all of that with the Centrallix
platform packages.

License:

OpenLayers is distributed under a 2-clause BSD type license.  It is licensed
separately from the rest of the Centrallix platform, but is compatible with
the LGPL licensing of the centrallix-os package in the Centrallix platform.
