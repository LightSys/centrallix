/* Description: Extension of the xhash system for Centrallix that 	*/
/*		allows for the entries in the hash table to be auto-	*/
/*		matically removed after a certain amount of time or	*/
/*		accesses to the table.  Normally uses a LRU discard	*/
/*		algorithm, with locking of entries to avoid possible	*/
/*		race conditions.  This module is especially applicable	*/
/*		as a cache controller.					*/
/*									*/
/* Usage:	This module is used by first creating a hashqueue with	*/
/*		xhqInit, using the hashqueue as described below, and	*/
/*		then de-initializing the thing with xhqDeInit.  The	*/
/*		XHashQueue datastructure itself must be pre-allocated.	*/
/*									*/
/*		To add an item to the queue, use xhqAdd.  A reference	*/
/*		pointer is returned, which should be treated as opaque.	*/
/*		with this reference pointer, you can get the pointer	*/
/*		to the item's data using xhqGetData, lock the item in	*/
/*		memory using xhqLockItem, or unlock it to free it to be	*/
/*		discarded at some point, using xhqUnlockItem.  When 	*/
/*		done with the reference to the item, call xhqUnlink.	*/
/*		This is necessary to prevent discarding of an item	*/
/*		while a routine is using it.  Such link counting is	*/
/*		different from the lock/unlock feature for items; the	*/
/*		latter is used to hold an item in memory because some	*/
/*		further processing on it needs to take place at some	*/
/*		later point, even though the reference is unlinked.	*/
/*									*/
/*		To find an item in the queue, use xhqLookup.  A 	*/
/*		reference pointer is returned; see the Add section above*/
/*		for more information.					*/
/*									*/
/*		To remove an item, first it must be added or looked up.	*/
/*		Then xhqRemove can be called in lieu of xhqUnlink.  If	*/
/*		the discard_fn SHOULD NOT be called as a result of the	*/
/*		xhqRemove, include XHQ_UF_NOCALLDISCARD in flags.	*/
/*									*/
/*		To iterate through items in the hashqueue, first lock	*/
/*		the queue using xhqLock, iterate using xhqGetFirst and	*/
/*		xhqGetNext, and then unlock using xhqUnlock.		*/
/*									*/
/*		To perform operations on the queue during iteration	*/
/*		while the queue is externally locked, pass the flag	*/
/*		XHQ_UF_PRELOCKED to the routines that handle an element.*/
/*									*/
/*		When an element is to be discarded, the discard_fn	*/
/*		is called with the queue and the element as the first	*/
/*		and second parameters.  The hashqueue is locked, so 	*/
/*		operations can be performed with the PRELOCKED flag.	*/
/*		The discard routine SHOULD NOT FREE XHQElement MEMORY,	*/
/*		but rather only consider the data from xhqGetData.	*/
/*		The third parameter passed is a status indication of	*/
/*		whether the element is xhqLockItem'ed.  Most discard	*/
/*		routines will fail if this is true (1).  Other such	*/
/*		routines will attempt to tidy things up so the element	*/
/*		can be successfully discarded.	The function should	*/
/*		return 0 on success, -1 on failure to discard.		*/
/*									*/
/*		The full_fn is called when an attempt is made to add	*/
/*		an element to the queue, but MaxElements has been 	*/
/*		reached and no elements could be successfully discarded.*/
/*		This function should return 0 if it was able to free up	*/
/*		some elements, or -1 if no more elements were able to	*/
/*		be freed and the xhqAdd should fail.  This function is 	*/
/*		called with the queue locked.				*/
