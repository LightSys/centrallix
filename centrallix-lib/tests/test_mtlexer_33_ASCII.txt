119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. 119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 
119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. 119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. 119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. 119:11 Thy word have I 
hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. 119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. 119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. 119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
