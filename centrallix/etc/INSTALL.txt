The Centrallix ObjectSystem
----------------------------

This is a filesystem-based objectsystem.  Included in this directory
are the Centrallix bootstrap configuration files.  They normally
live in /usr/local/etc - put them there and the default install of
Centrallix should hum along just fine.  What follows is a quick
explanation of what these three critical files do.

centrallix.conf:

    This main configuration file contains key configuration information
    for several of Centrallix's modules.  A sample configuration file is
    contained in this directory, and should be placed in /usr/local/etc.
    You can change the configuration file used via the -c flag to 
    the Centrallix program itself.

    Since the filename for "rootnode" must be predictable, the OSML will
    not be able to determine its type automatically (or else the type of
    the rootnode would end up being hardcoded into the OSML startup code).
    Thus, the OSML rootnode pseudo-driver is instructed to read the type
    from the attribute "rootnode_type" in this file.  The type should 
    be one of those listed in types.cfg.


rootnode:

    The "rootnode" file contains data which would normally be a node
    object in Centrallix itself.  The rootnode is handled by a special
    objectsystem driver that is builtin to the OSML.  Normally the 
    rootnode is based in the filesystem, and so the UXD filesystem
    driver is invoked for the root of the objectsystem.  This is the
    default - make sure the path in "rootnode" points to the correct
    location for the objectsystem, normally /var/centrallix/os on RH7
    systems or /home/centrallix/os on RH6 systems.

    Don't understand all of this jibber-jabber about node objects and
    rootnodes?  Don't worry - just make sure the path is correct in
    the rootnode file and install the rootnode file in /usr/local/etc.

    The name of this file can be changed by changing the attribute
    "rootnode_file" in the main config file centrallix.conf.


types.cfg:

    Centrallix has a hierarchical object and content type database,
    which exists as /usr/local/etc/types.cfg normally.  This file must be
    in a predictable location for Centrallix.  The location of this file
    can be changed by changing the "types_config" attribute in the main
    config file centrallix.conf.

charsetmap.cfg

    In the POSIX specifications, MySQL, and the other components that are being
    used in Centrallix, character encodings are specified by strings.  This 
    makes sense for most applications (Like centrallix) where a variable number
    of locales could be used, but because the different components refer to the 
    character sets with different names, it can be very hard to coordinate the 
    character encoding between all parts of an application.  The charsetmap.cfg
    file is meant to fix this problem by mapping what the system calls an
    encoding to what all the other components call that encoding.  See the
    default charsetmap.cfg for an example of what it should look like and the
    different tags that are currently recognized by Centrallix and its plugins.
