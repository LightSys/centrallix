##NAME Multiplication (*) inconsistencies with string values

# These same operands work with + and - because they convert the string to an
# int when possible, but with multiplication it throws an error
query select '-2 * "3"' = -2 * "3"

# Similarly for consistency I would argue that this should result in an integer
query select '4 * "4"' = 4 * "4"
